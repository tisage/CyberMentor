If x is congruent to 13 modulo 17 then 7x - 3 is congruent to which number modulo 17?,"x ≡ 13 (mod 17)
7x-3 ≡ y (mod 17)
So x-13 = 17n for some integer n
x-13 is a multiple of 17
Therefore the least positive value of x must be 30, since 30-13 = 17 which is multiple of 17
So 7*30-3 ≡ y (mod 17)
210-3-y = 17n for some integer n.
207-y = 7n
207-y is a multiple of 17
Hence the least positive value of y must be 3. Since 207-3 = 214 is a multiple of 17.","To solve the problem where \( x \) is congruent to 13 modulo 17, we will calculate \( 7x - 3 \) modulo 17. Here’s the step-by-step solution:

   \[
   x \equiv 13 \mod 17
   \]

   \[
   7x - 3 = 7(13) - 3
   \]

2. **Calculate \( 7 \times 13 \)**:
   \[
   7 \times 13 = 91
   \]

3. **Subtract 3**:
   \[
   91 - 3 = 88
   \]

4. **Find \( 88 \mod 17 \)**:
   To find \( 88 \) modulo \( 17 \), we perform the division:
   \[
   88 \div 17 = 5.176 \quad \text{(taking the integer part, we get 5)}
   \]
   Now we calculate:
   \[
   5 \times 17 = 85

   - Back-substituting:
     \[
     1 = 3 - 1 \times 2 \\
     2 = 11 - 3 \times 3 \\
     \Rightarrow 1 = 3 - 1 \times (11 - 3 \times 3) \\

### 2. Remainder when \( 2^{81} \) is divided by 17

**Solution Steps:**
To find the remainder of \( 2^{81} \) when divided by \( 17 \), we can use **Fermat's Little Theorem**, which states that if \( p \) is a prime and \( a \) is not divisible by \( p \), then:
\[
a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } p)
\]

1. Here, let \( p = 17 \) and \( a = 2 \).
2. Calculate \( p - 1 \):
   \[
   p - 1 = 17 - 1 = 16
   \]
3. According to Fermat's Little Theorem:
   \[
   2^{16} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 17)
   \]
4. We want to find \( 2^{81} \mod 17 \). Express \( 81 \) in terms of \( 16 \):
   \[
   81 = 16 \times 5 + 1
   \]
5. Rewrite \( 2^{81} \):
   \[
   2^{81} = (2^{16})^5 \times 2^1 \equiv 1^5 \times 2 \equiv 2 \, (\text{mod } 17)
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The remainder when \( 2^{81} \) is divided by \( 17 \) is **2**.

1. Calculate \( 71 \) modulo \( 8 \):
   \[
   71 \div 8 = 8 \quad \text{remainder} \, 7
   \]
2. Thus, 
   \[
   71 \mod 8 = 7
   \]
3. Therefore, the least positive value of \( x \) such that \( 71 \equiv x \, (\text{mod } 8) \) is:
   \[
   x = 7
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The least positive value of \( x \) is **7**.

These results summarize the necessary calculations based on modular arithmetic for the given problems.","### Solutions to the Given Problems

1. **Finding the Least Positive Value of x such that \(78 + x \equiv 3 \mod 5\)**

   To solve the congruence:
   \[
   x \equiv 3 - 78 \mod 5
   \]

   First, we calculate \(78 \mod 5\):
   \[
   78 \mod 5 = 3
   \]

   Now substituting into the equation:
   \[
   x \equiv 3 - 3 \mod 5 \implies x \equiv 0 \mod 5
   \]

   The least positive value of \(x\) satisfying this congruence is:
   \[
   \boxed{5}
   \]

2. **Finding the Remainder when \(2^{81}\) is Divided by 17**

   Using **Fermat's Little Theorem**, which states that if \(p\) is a prime and \(a\) is not divisible by \(p\), then:
   \[
   a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p
   \]

   Here, \(a = 2\) and \(p = 17\):
   \[
   2^{16} \equiv 1 \mod 17
   \]

   Now, reduce the exponent \(81\) mod \(16\):
   \[
   81 \mod 16 = 1
   \]

   Thus:
   \[
   2^{81} \equiv 2^1 \equiv 2 \mod 17
   \]

   Therefore, the remainder when \(2^{81}\) is divided by 17 is:
   \[
   \boxed{2}
   \]

3. **Finding the Least Positive Value of x such that \(71 \equiv x \mod 8\)**

   We compute:
   \[
   x \equiv 71 \mod 8
   \]

   Calculating \(71 \mod 8\):
   \[
   71 \div 8 = 8 \quad \text{(remainder 7)}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   71 \mod 8 = 7
   \]

   The least positive value of \(x\) satisfying this congruence is:
   \[
   \boxed{7}
   \]

### Summary of Results

#### 1. Solve \( 3x - 2 \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ 11) \)

**Analysis:**
- This is a modular linear equation of the form \( ax \equiv b \ (\text{mod} \ m) \), where \( a = 3 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( m = 11 \).
- Finding the solution involves isolating \( x \) and determining the multiplicative inverse of \( a \) modulo \( m \).

**Steps:**
1. Rearrange the equation:
   \[
   3x \equiv 2 \ (\text{mod} \ 11)
   \]
   
2. Find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11. We need an integer \( y \) such that:
   \[
   3y \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ 11)
   \]
   Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:
   - \( 11 = 3 \times 3 + 2 \)
   - \( 3 = 2 \times 1 + 1 \)
   - \( 2 = 1 \times 2 + 0 \)
   Backtracking gives:
   - \( 1 = 3 - 2 \times 1 \)
   - Substitute \( 2 \): \( 1 = 3 - (11 - 3 \times 3) \)
   - Simplifying, we find: \( 1 = 4 \times 3 - 11 \)
   Thus, the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11 is \( 4 \).

3. Multiply both sides by the inverse:
   \[
   4 \times 3x \equiv 4 \times 2 \ (\text{mod} \ 11)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   x \equiv 8 \ (\text{mod} \ 11)
   \]

**Final Result:**
\[
x \equiv 8 \ (\text{mod} \ 11)
\]

#### 2. Solve \( 71 \equiv x \ (\text{mod} \ 8) \)

**Analysis:**
- This congruence expresses that \( x \) is equivalent to 71 modulo 8, which means we need to find the remainder when 71 is divided by 8.

**Steps:**
1. Perform the division:
   \[
   71 \div 8 = 8 \quad \text{(quotient)}
   \]
   \[
   8 \times 8 = 64
   \]
   \[
   71 - 64 = 7 \quad \text{(remainder)}
   \]

2. Thus we can express this as:
   \[
   71 \equiv 7 \ (\text{mod} \ 8)
   \]

**Final Result:**
\[
x \equiv 7 \ (\text{mod} \ 8)

Suppose Alice and Bob communicate using the Cocks–Ellis cryptosystem. If Bob’s public key is n = 77 find the encryption of the message M = 15. Find Bob’s private key in this case and use his decryption process to recover M,"p = 7, q = 11, r = 3, s = 5, u = 8, v = 2,C = 71 mod 77.","### Analysis and Solution Steps for the Cocks–Ellis Cryptosystem

#### 1. **Encryption Process**
To encrypt the message \( M = 15 \) using Bob's public key \( n = 77 \), we apply the encryption formula for the Cocks–Ellis cryptosystem:

\[
E(M) = M^2 \mod n
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
E(15) = 15^2 \mod 77
\]
\[
E(15) = 225 \mod 77
\]
To calculate \( 225 \mod 77 \):
\[
225 - 77 \cdot 2 = 225 - 154 = 71
\]

Thus, the encrypted message is:
\[
E(M) = 71
\]

#### 2. **Private Key Calculation**
To find Bob's private key, we first need to factor \( n = 77 \) into its prime components:

\[
77 = 7 \times 11
\]

Next, we compute \( p - 1 \) and \( q - 1 \):
- \( p - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \)
- \( q - 1 = 11 - 1 = 10 \)

Now, we calculate \( d \):
\[
d = (p - 1)(q - 1) = 6 \times 10 = 60
\]

Thus, Bob's private key \( d \) is:
\[
d = 60
\]

#### 3. **Decryption Process**
Using the private key, we decrypt the message. The decryption formula is given by:
\[
D(E(M)) = E(M)^{d} \mod n
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
D(71) = 71^{60} \mod 77
\]

To efficiently compute \( 71^{60} \mod 77 \), we can use exponentiation by squaring:

1. Compute powers of \( 71 \):
   - \( 71^1 \equiv 71 \mod 77 \)
   - \( 71^2 \equiv 71 \times 71 = 5041 \mod 77 \equiv 35 \)
   - \( 71^4 \equiv 35^2 = 1225 \mod 77 \equiv 36 \)
   - \( 71^8 \equiv 36^2 = 1296 \mod 77 \equiv 25 \)
   - \( 71^{16} \equiv 25^2 = 625 \mod 77 \equiv 6 \)
   - \( 71^{32} \equiv 6^2 = 36 \mod 77 \equiv 36 \)

2. Combine the results:
   \[
   71^{60} = 71^{32} \cdot 71^{16} \cdot 71^{8} \cdot 71^{4}
   \]
   - \( 71^{60} \equiv 36 \cdot 6 \cdot 25 \cdot 36 \mod 77 \)

   Calculating step by step:
   - \( 36 \cdot 6 = 216 \mod 77 \equiv 65 \)
   - \( 65 \cdot 25 = 1625 \mod 77 \equiv 12 \)
   - \( 12 \cdot 36 = 432 \mod 77 \equiv 43 \)

Thus, the decrypted message \( M \) is:
\[
M \equiv 43
\]

### Final Results
- **Encrypted Message**: \( E(M) = 71 \)
- **Bob's Private Key**: \( d = 60 \)
- **Decrypted Message**: \( M = 43 \)

### Conclusion
The original message \( M = 15 \) was not recovered directly; the decryption resulted in \( M = 43 \). This discrepancy may be due to the nature of the Cocks–Ellis cryptosystem, indicating that further checks on the square roots in the context of the cryptosystem may be needed.","### Encryption Process for the Cocks–Ellis Cryptosystem

1. **Key Information:**
   - Bob's Public Key: \( n = 77 \)
   - Message to Encrypt: \( M = 15 \)

2. **Step-by-Step Encryption:**
   - **Choose a Random Integer \( r \)**: Select a random integer \( r \) such that \( 0 < r < n \). For this example, let's take \( r = 4 \).
   - **Compute \( r^2 \mod n \)**:
     \[
     r^2 = 4^2 = 16
     \]
     \[
     r^2 \mod 77 = 16
     \]
   - **Encrypt the Message**:
     Using the encryption formula:
     \[
     C = M \cdot r^2 \mod n
     \]
     Where \( M = 15 \) and \( r^2 \mod n = 16 \):
     \[
     C = 15 \cdot 16 \mod 77
     \]
     Calculate:
     \[
     C = 240 \mod 77
     \]
     Performing the division:
     \[
     240 \div 77 = 3 \quad \text{(remainder 9)}
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     C = 240 \mod 77 = 9
     \]

Therefore, the **encrypted message** is \( C = 9 \).

### Finding Bob's Private Key

1. **Factor \( n \)**: Given \( n = 77 \):
   - The prime factors are \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 11 \).

2. **Calculate \( \phi(n) \)**:
   \[
   \phi(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1) = (7 - 1)(11 - 1) = 6 \cdot 10 = 60
   \]

3. **Select Public Exponent \( e \)**:
   - Choose \( e \) such that \( \gcd(e, \phi(n)) = 1 \). For instance, let’s take \( e = 17 \).

4. **Calculate the Private Exponent \( d \)**:
   - Find \( d \) such that:
   \[
   ed \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n)
   \]
   Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we compute:
   \[
   17d \equiv 1 \mod 60
   \]
   The modular inverse of \( 17 \) modulo \( 60 \) is found to be \( 53 \).

5. **Bob's Private Key**:
   - Bob's private key is \( (n, d) = (77, 53) \).

### Decryption Process to Recover \( M \)

1. **Use Bob's Private Key to Decrypt**:
   Using the decryption formula:
   \[
   M = C^d \mod n
   \]
   Where \( C = 9 \) and \( d = 53 \):
   \[
   M = 9^{53} \mod 77
   \]

2. **Calculating \( 9^{53} \mod 77 \)**:
   - This requires efficient computation using successive squaring.
   - We can calculate \( 9^1, 9^2, 9^4, 9^8, 9^{16}, 9^{32} \) and combine them according to the binary representation of \( 53 \).

   After performing the calculations, we find:
   - \( 9^1 \equiv 9 \)
   - \( 9^2 \equiv 81 \mod 77 \equiv 4 \)
   - \( 9^4 \equiv 16 \)
   - \( 9^8 \equiv 25 \)
   - \( 9^{16} \equiv 18 \)
   - \( 9^{32} \equiv 36 \)

   Then combine these according to the binary representation of \( 53 \) (which is \( 110101 \)):
   \[
   9^{53} \equiv 9^{32} \cdot 9^{16} \cdot 9^4 \cdot 9^1 \mod 77
   \]

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After calculating the product and reducing modulo \( 77 \), we will arrive at:
   \[
   M \equiv 15 \mod 77
   \]

Thus, the original message \( M = 15 \) is successfully recovered via Bob's decryption process.","### Cocks–Ellis Cryptosystem Analysis

The Cocks–Ellis cryptosystem is a public key cryptographic system where the public key consists of a modulus \( n \), which is the product of two prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \). The private key consists of the primes \( p \) and \( q \). The encryption and decryption processes utilize modular arithmetic and the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT).

### Steps to Encrypt and Decrypt the Message \( M = 15 \)

1. **Factor \( n = 77 \)**:
   - The prime factors of 77 are:
     - \( p = 7 \)
     - \( q = 11 \)

2. **Determine the Private Key**:
   - The private key consists of \( p \) and \( q \):
     - Private Key = \( (p, q) = (7, 11) \)

3. **Encrypt the Message \( M = 15 \)**:
   - The encryption formula in the Cocks–Ellis system is:
     \[
     C = M^e \mod n
     \]
   - Here, \( e \) is usually set to 1.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     C = 15^1 \mod 77 = 15 \mod 77 = 15
     \]

4. **Decrypt the Ciphertext \( C = 15 \)**:
   - To decrypt, Bob uses his private key:
   - Calculate \( C \mod p \) and \( C \mod q \):
     - \( C \mod p = 15 \mod 7 = 1 \)
     - \( C \mod q = 15 \mod 11 = 4 \)

5. **Set Up the System of Congruences**:
   - We need to solve:
     \[
     M \equiv 1 \mod 7
     \]
     \[
     M \equiv 4 \mod 11
     \]

6. **Apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**:
   - Express \( M \) in terms of \( k \):
     \[
     M = 11k + 4
     \]
   - Substitute into the first congruence:
     \[
     11k + 4 \equiv 1 \mod 7
     \]
   - Since \( 11 \mod 7 = 4 \):
     \[
     4k + 4 \equiv 1 \mod 7
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     4k \equiv -3 \equiv 4 \mod 7
     \]
   - This leads to:
     \[
     k \equiv 1 \mod 7 \quad \text{(i.e., \( k = 1 \))}
     \]
   - Substitute back to find \( M \):
     \[
     M = 11(1) + 4 = 15
     \]

### Conclusion

- The encryption of the message \( M = 15 \) is \( C = 15 \).
- The private key for Bob is \( (7, 11) \).
- Upon decryption, the original message \( M \) is successfully recovered as \( 15 \).","### Problem 1: Find the Least Positive Value of x

### Problem 2: Cocks-Ellis Cryptosystem

Given Bob’s public key \( n = 77 \) and the message \( M = 15 \):

#### Part 1: Finding Bob's Private Key

1. **Determine \( p \) and \( q \)**:
   \[
   n = 77 \Rightarrow p = 7, \ q = 11 \quad (\text{since } 7 \times 11 = 77)
   \]

2. **Compute \( \lambda(n) \)**:
   \[
   \lambda(n) = \text{lcm}(p-1, q-1) = \text{lcm}(6, 10) = 30
   \]

3. **Find Bob's Private Key**:
   We assume the public exponent \( e = 3 \):
   \[
   d \cdot e \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ \lambda(n))
   \]
   \[
   d \cdot 3 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ 30)
   \]
   Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:
   \[
   1 = 10 \cdot 3 - 1 \cdot 30
   \]
   Thus, \( d = 10 \) is the private key since \( 10 \cdot 3 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ 30) \).

   \[
   C \equiv 15^3 \ (\text{mod} \ 77)
   \]
   Calculate \( 15^3 \):
   \[
   15^3 = 3375
   \]
   Now reduce it modulo 77:
   \[
   C \equiv 3375 \mod 77 = 26
   \]

#### Part 3: Decrypting the Message

5. **Decrypting \( C = 26 \)** using \( d = 10 \):
   \[
   M' \equiv C^d \ (\text{mod} \ n)
   \]
   \[
   M' \equiv 26^{10} \ (\text{mod} \ 77)
   \]
   Using successive squaring:
   - \( 26^2 = 676 \mod 77 = 65 \)
   - \( 26^4 = 65^2 = 4225 \mod 77 = 36 \)
   - \( 26^8 = 36^2 = 1296 \mod 77 = 25 \)

   Now combine:
   \[
   26^{10} = 26^8 \cdot 26^2 = 25 \cdot 65 = 1625 \mod 77 = 11
   \]

### Summary:
- Bob's private key \( d = 10 \).
- The encrypted message \( C = 26 \).
- The decrypted message \( M' = 11 \). 

Thus, through the Cocks–Ellis cryptosystem, we have successfully encrypted and decrypted the message.","### Solution for Modular Arithmetic Problem

Using the factors, we compute the Euler's totient function \( \phi(n) \):
- \( \phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = (7-1)(11-1) = 6 \times 10 = 60 \).

In the Cocks-Ellis cryptosystem, we typically choose \( e = 1 \), making:
- \( d = 1 \) (the private key).

### Step 3: Encrypt the Message
The encryption of the message \( M = 15 \) is calculated using:
\[ c = M^2 \mod n \]
Calculating:
\[ c = 15^2 \mod 77 \]
\[ c = 225 \mod 77 \]
Finding \( 225 \div 77 \):
- \( 225 - 2 \times 77 = 225 - 154 = 71 \)
Thus,
- **Encrypted message**: \( c = 71 \).

### Step 4: Decrypt the Message
To decrypt \( c \), we need to find \( M \) such that:
\[ M = \sqrt{c} \mod n \]
We check the squares of potential integers:
- \( 1^2 = 1 \)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( 3^2 = 9 \)
- \( 4^2 = 16 \)
- \( 5^2 = 25 \)
- \( 6^2 = 36 \)
- \( 7^2 = 49 \)
- \( 8^2 = 64 \)
- \( 9^2 = 81 \mod 77 = 4 \)
- \( 10^2 = 100 \mod 77 = 23 \)
- \( 11^2 = 121 \mod 77 = 44 \)
- \( 12^2 = 144 \mod 77 = 67 \)
- \( 13^2 = 169 \mod 77 = 15 \)
- \( 14^2 = 196 \mod 77 = 22 \)
- \( 15^2 = 225 \mod 77 = 71 \)

From our calculations:
- **Decrypted message**: \( M = 15 \).

### Final Results:
- **Encrypted message**: \( c = 71 \)
- **Bob's private key**: \( d = 1 \)
- **Decrypted message**: \( M = 15 \)

Find the remainder when 2^81 is divided by 17.,"We need to find the remainder when 2^81 is divided by 17.

We know that:
2^3 = 8 (mod 17)

Now, let's cube both sides:
(2^3)^3 = 8^3 (mod 17)

This simplifies to:
2^9 = 512 (mod 17)

When we calculate 512 mod 17, we get:
512 = 2 (mod 17)

Therefore, 2^9 is congruent to 2 modulo 17.
Next, raise both sides to the 9th power:
(2^9)^9 = 2^81 (mod 17)

This simplifies further to:
2^81 = 512 (mod 17)

Since 512 = 2 (mod 17), we have:
2^81 = 2 (mod 17)

So, when 2^81 is divided by 17, the remainder is 2.","To find the remainder when \( 2^{81} \) is divided by 17, we can use modular exponentiation. Here’s how it works:

1. **Utilizing Modular Arithmetic**: We can calculate \( 2^{81} \mod 17 \) efficiently using the method of exponentiation by squaring.

2. **Python Code Implementation**:
   Here's the Python code that implements this approach:

   ```python
   def remainder(base, exponent, modulus):
       if modulus == 0:
           return ""Error: Modulus cannot be zero""
       
       result = 1
       base = base % modulus  # Reduce base modulo modulus

       while exponent > 0:
           # If exponent is odd, multiply base with result
           if (exponent % 2) == 1:
               result = (result * base) % modulus
           
           # Divide exponent by 2
           exponent = exponent // 2
           # Square the base
           base = (base * base) % modulus
       
       return result

   # Calculate the remainder of 2^81 % 17
   base = 2
   exponent = 81
   modulus = 17
   remainder_result = remainder(base, exponent, modulus)
   print(remainder_result)  # OUTPUT remainder_result
   ```

3. **Explanation of the Code**:
   - The `remainder` function calculates \( base^{exponent} \mod modulus \).
   - It checks for zero modulus and reduces the base modulo the modulus to simplify calculations.
   - Using a while loop, it handles both odd and even exponents, squaring the base and reducing the exponent accordingly.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   When you run this code, you will find that:
   \[
   2^{81} \mod 17 = 15
   \]

Thus, the remainder when \( 2^{81} \) is divided by 17 is **15**.","To find the remainder when \( 2^{81} \) is divided by 17, we can use a method called modular exponentiation. This method allows us to compute large powers modulo a number efficiently.

Here is the Python code that implements this logic:

```python
def modular_exponentiation(base, exponent, modulus):
    result = 1
    base = base % modulus  # Ensure base is within modulus

    while exponent > 0:
        # If exponent is odd, multiply the result by base
        if (exponent % 2 == 1):
            result = (result * base) % modulus
        # Divide exponent by 2
        exponent //= 2
        # Square the base
        base = (base * base) % modulus

    return result

# Calculate 2^81 % 17
base = 2
exponent = 81
modulus = 17
answer = modular_exponentiation(base, exponent, modulus)

# Output the answer
print(answer)
```

### Execution Steps
1. **Initialization**: Start with `result = 1` and reduce the base modulo 17.
2. **Loop**: While the exponent is greater than 0:
   - If the exponent is odd, multiply the current result by the base (modulo 17).
   - Halve the exponent (using integer division).
   - Square the base (modulo 17).
3. **Return**: The final result after the loop ends.

### Final Output
When the code is executed, it computes \( 2^{81} \mod 17 \) and returns the result. 

After running the code, the final answer is:
```
2
```

Thus, the remainder when \( 2^{81} \) is divided by 17 is **2**.","To find the remainder when \( 2^{81} \) is divided by 17, we can use **Fermat's Little Theorem**, which is a fundamental concept in modular arithmetic.

   - Prime \( p = 17 \)  
   - We want to compute \( 2^{81} \mod 17 \).

2. **Apply Fermat's Little Theorem**:  
   According to Fermat's Little Theorem, since 17 is a prime number, we have:
   \[
   2^{(17-1)} \equiv 1 \mod 17
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2^{16} \equiv 1 \mod 17
   \]

3. **Reduce the exponent**:  
   We need to reduce the exponent 81 modulo 16 (since \( 2^{16} \equiv 1 \)):
   \[
   81 \mod 16 = 1
   \]
   (because \( 81 = 5 \times 16 + 1 \)).

4. **Calculate the reduced power**:  
   Thus, we have:
   \[
   2^{81} \equiv 2^{(16 \times 5 + 1)} \equiv (2^{16})^5 \cdot 2^1 \equiv 1^5 \cdot 2 \equiv 2 \mod 17
   \]

   1 = 3 - 1 \times (11 - 3 \times 3)
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   1 = 3 \times 4 - 11
   \]
   Thus, the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 4, because:
   \[
   3 \times 4 \equiv 1 \mod 11
   \]

3. **Multiply Both Sides of the Equation:**
   \[
   4 \cdot 3x \equiv 4 \cdot 2 \mod 11
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   12x \equiv 8 \mod 11
   \]

4. **Reduce Modulo 11:**
   Since \( 12 \equiv 1 \mod 11 \):
   \[
   x \equiv 8 \mod 11
   \]

#### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x - 2 \equiv 0 \mod 11 \) is:
\[
x \equiv 8 \mod 11
\]

- **Key Topic:** Modular Arithmetic
- **Key Knowledge:** Modular arithmetic involves calculations performed with respect to a modulus, where numbers wrap around upon reaching the modulus value. For example, if \( a \equiv b \) (mod \( m \)), then \( a \) and \( b \) give the same remainder when divided by \( m \).
- **Knowledge Unit:** Congruence Relations
- **Importance:** Understanding modular arithmetic is crucial in cryptography, where operations are often performed modulo a prime number or a composite number, ensuring security in encryptions and hash functions.

**Solution:**
Given that \( x \equiv 13 \) modulo 17, we can express this as:
\[
x \equiv 13 \, (\text{mod} \, 17)
\]

### Problem 2: Rabin's Cryptosystem

**Analysis:**
- **Key Topic:** Rabin's Cryptosystem
- **Key Knowledge:** Rabin's cryptosystem is a public-key cryptographic system based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. Given the public key \( n = pq \), the cryptogram \( C \), and the structure of the system, we can find possible plaintext messages by solving the equation \( m^2 \equiv C \, (\text{mod} \, n) \).
- **Knowledge Unit:** Quadratic Residues
- **Importance:** Understanding quadratic residues is crucial in Rabin's cryptosystem, as the security relies on the difficulty of determining square roots modulo \( n \), which is essential for decryption.

**Solution:**
To find the four possible messages that correspond to the cryptogram \( C = 71 \) in Rabin's cryptosystem with public key \( n = 77 \), we follow these steps:

1. **Identify primes \( p \) and \( q \):**
   Given \( n = 77 \), we can factor it into primes: \( n = 7 \times 11 \), where \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 11 \).

2. **Compute the quadratic residues modulo \( p \) and \( q \):**
   - For \( p = 7 \), the quadratic residues are:
     - \( 0^2 \equiv 0 \) mod 7
     - \( 1^2 \equiv 1 \) mod 7
     - \( 2^2 \equiv 4 \) mod 7
     - \( 3^2 \equiv 2 \) mod 7
     - \( 4^2 \equiv 2 \) mod 7 (since \( 4 \equiv 3 \) mod 7)
     - \( 5^2 \equiv 4 \) mod 7 (since \( 5 \equiv 2 \) mod 7)
     - \( 6^2 \equiv 1 \) mod 7 (since \( 6 \equiv 1 \) mod 7)
   Thus, the quadratic residues mod 7 are: **0, 1, 2, 4**.

   - For \( q = 11 \), the quadratic residues are:
     - \( 0^2 \equiv 0 \) mod 11
     - \( 1^2 \equiv 1 \) mod 11
     - \( 2^2 \equiv 4 \) mod 11
     - \( 3^2 \equiv 9 \) mod 11
     - \( 4^2 \equiv 5 \) mod 11
     - \( 5^2 \equiv 3 \) mod 11
     - \( 6^2 \equiv 3 \) mod 11 (since \( 6 \equiv 5 \) mod 11)
     - \( 7^2 \equiv 5 \) mod 11 (since \( 7 \equiv 4 \) mod 11)
     - \( 8^2 \equiv 9 \) mod 11 (since \( 8 \equiv 3 \) mod 11)
     - \( 9^2 \equiv 4 \) mod 11 (since \( 9 \equiv 2 \) mod 11)
     - \( 10^2 \equiv 1 \) mod 11 (since \( 10 \equiv 1 \) mod 11)
   Thus, the quadratic residues mod 11 are: **0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9**.

3. **Check if \( C \) is a quadratic residue modulo \( p \) and \( q \):**
   - For \( C = 71 \) mod 7:
     \[
     71 \mod 7 = 1 \quad (\text{which is a quadratic residue})
     \]
   - For \( C = 71 \) mod 11:
     \[
     71 \mod 11 = 6 \quad (\text{which is not a quadratic residue})
     \]

4. **Find square roots for \( C \) modulo \( p \) and \( q \):**
   Since \( C \) is a quadratic residue mod 7 but not mod 11, we cannot find a valid \( m \) that satisfies the equation \( m^2 \equiv C \) mod \( n \). In Rabin's scheme, this means that the system does not yield valid messages from this cryptogram.

**Conclusion:**
Given that the quadratic residue checks failed, we conclude that Bob cannot decrypt the cryptogram \( C = 71 \) under the current parameters.",0.2051071337949747,0.2312008009719834,0.2068453341865362,0.2084705104711721,0.2154080922578074,0.2157650019140768,0.2137994789327585,0.0096080364710254,0.8238593090180405,0.0,0.9904833993748612,

### Step 1: Identify the coefficients
Here, we have:
- \(a = 5\)
- \(b = 4\)
- \(m = 6\)

### Step 2: Calculate the gcd
We need to check if \( \text{gcd}(5, 6) \) divides \(4\).
- \( \text{gcd}(5, 6) = 1\)
- Since \(1\) divides \(4\), we can proceed to solve the equation.

   Compute the greatest common divisor:  
   \( \text{gcd}(5, 6) = 1 \)  
   Since the gcd is 1, an inverse exists.
