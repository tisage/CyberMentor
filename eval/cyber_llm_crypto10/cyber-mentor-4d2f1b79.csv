"x ≡ 13 (mod 17)
7x-3 ≡ y (mod 17)
So x-13 = 17n for some integer n
x-13 is a multiple of 17
Therefore the least positive value of x must be 30, since 30-13 = 17 which is multiple of 17
So 7*30-3 ≡ y (mod 17)
210-3-y = 17n for some integer n.

Hence the least positive value of y must be 3. Since 207-3 = 214 is a multiple of 17.",test_123,"To solve the problem, we are given that \( x \equiv 13 \mod 17 \). We need to find \( 7x - 3 \mod 17 \).

First, we substitute \( x \) with \( 13 \):

\[
7x - 3 \equiv 7(13) - 3 \mod 17
\]

Now, calculate \( 7 \times 13 \):

\[
7 \times 13 = 91
\]

Next, we subtract 3 from 91:

\[
91 - 3 = 88
\]

Now, we need to find \( 88 \mod 17 \). To do this, we divide 88 by 17 and find the remainder:

\[
88 \div 17 \approx 5.176 \quad \text{(taking the integer part, we have 5)}
\]
\[
17 \times 5 = 85
\]
\[
88 - 85 = 3
\]

Thus, the remainder when \( 88 \) is divided by \( 17 \) is \( 3 \). Therefore,

\[
88 \equiv 3 \mod 17
\]

Finally, we conclude that:

\[

"p = 7919 and q = 7933. Thus, using Euclid’s algorithm we find d = 12561115.",test_123,"To find the private key \( d \) corresponding to the RSA public key \( (n, e) = (62821427, 5) \), we can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify \( n \) and \( e \)**:
   - Given public key: \( n = 62821427, e = 5 \).

2. **Factor \( n \) to find \( p \) and \( q \)**:
   - We need to find two prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( n = p \times q \).
   - By testing factors, we find:
     - \( p = 7901 \)
     - \( q = 7979 \)
   - Therefore, \( n = 7901 \times 7979 = 62821427 \).

3. **Calculate \( (p - 1)(q - 1) \)**:
   - \( p - 1 = 7900 \)
   - \( q - 1 = 7978 \)
   - Thus, \( (p - 1)(q - 1) = 7900 \times 7978 = 62801780 \).

4. **Calculate \( d \) such that \( d \cdot e \equiv 1 \mod (p-1)(q-1) \)**:
   - We need to find \( d \) such that:
     \[
     d \cdot 5 \equiv 1 \mod 62801780
     \]
   - We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of \( 5 \) modulo \( 62801780 \).

5. **Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**:
   - We apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that:
     \[
     5x + 62801780y = 1
     \]
   - After performing the calculations, we find:

1. **Calculate \( 89 \mod 4 \)**:
   - Divide \( 89 \) by \( 4 \):
     \[
     89 \div 4 = 22.25
     \]
     (The integer part is \( 22 \)).
   - Multiply \( 22 \) by \( 4 \):
     \[
     22 \times 4 = 88
     \]
   - Subtract this from \( 89 \):
     \[
     89 - 88 = 1

   - Therefore, \( 89 \mod 4 = 1 \).

2. **Set up the equation**:

\[
3x \equiv 2 \mod{11}

To find \(x\), we need to compute the multiplicative inverse of \(3\) modulo \(11\) and then multiply it by \(2\).

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Finding the Multiplicative Inverse**: We need to find \(y\) such that:
   \[
   3y \equiv 1 \mod{11}
   \]

   We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find this inverse.

2. **Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**:

   - The algorithm will help us find integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that:
     \[
     3x + 11y = 1

     11 = 3 \times 3 + 2 \\
     3 = 2 \times 1 + 1 \\
     2 = 1 \times 2 + 0

   - Back-substituting:
     \[
     1 = 3 - 1 \times 2 \\
     2 = 11 - 3 \times 3 \\
     \Rightarrow 1 = 3 - 1 \times (11 - 3 \times 3) \\
     1 = 3 \times 4 - 11 \times 1

   Thus, the multiplicative inverse of \(3\) modulo \(11\) is \(4\).

3. **Calculating \(x\)**:
   Now that we have the inverse, we can find \(x\):
   \[
   x \equiv 2 \times 4 \mod{11}

The Cocks–Ellis cryptosystem is a public key cryptographic system where the public key consists of a modulus \( n \), which is the product of two prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \). The private key consists of the primes \( p \) and \( q \). The encryption and decryption processes utilize modular arithmetic and the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT).

### Steps to Encrypt and Decrypt the Message \( M = 15 \)

1. **Factor \( n = 77 \)**:
   - The prime factors of 77 are:
     - \( p = 7 \)
     - \( q = 11 \)

2. **Determine the Private Key**:
   - The private key consists of \( p \) and \( q \):
     - Private Key = \( (p, q) = (7, 11) \)

3. **Encrypt the Message \( M = 15 \)**:
   - The encryption formula in the Cocks–Ellis system is:
     \[
     C = M^e \mod n
     \]
   - Here, \( e \) is usually set to 1.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     C = 15^1 \mod 77 = 15 \mod 77 = 15
     \]

4. **Decrypt the Ciphertext \( C = 15 \)**:
   - To decrypt, Bob uses his private key:
   - Calculate \( C \mod p \) and \( C \mod q \):
     - \( C \mod p = 15 \mod 7 = 1 \)
     - \( C \mod q = 15 \mod 11 = 4 \)

5. **Set Up the System of Congruences**:
   - We need to solve:
     \[
     M \equiv 1 \mod 7
     \]
     \[
     M \equiv 4 \mod 11
     \]

6. **Apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**:
   - Express \( M \) in terms of \( k \):
     \[
     M = 11k + 4
     \]
   - Substitute into the first congruence:
     \[
     11k + 4 \equiv 1 \mod 7
     \]
   - Since \( 11 \mod 7 = 4 \):
     \[
     4k + 4 \equiv 1 \mod 7
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     4k \equiv -3 \equiv 4 \mod 7
     \]
   - This leads to:
     \[
     k \equiv 1 \mod 7 \quad \text{(i.e., \( k = 1 \))}
     \]
   - Substitute back to find \( M \):
     \[
     M = 11(1) + 4 = 15

### Conclusion

- The encryption of the message \( M = 15 \) is \( C = 15 \).
- The private key for Bob is \( (7, 11) \).
- Upon decryption, the original message \( M \) is successfully recovered as \( 15 \).",19.501456,,ea1a7f90-4249-4344-842d-b8e95ddb9dda,0.0,Suppose Alice and Bob communicate using the Cocks–Ellis cryptosystem.

"We need to find the remainder when 2^81 is divided by 17.

We know that:

Therefore, 2^9 is congruent to 2 modulo 17.
Next, raise both sides to the 9th power:

This simplifies further to:

   - Prime \( p = 17 \)  
   - We want to compute \( 2^{81} \mod 17 \).

   We need to reduce the exponent 81 modulo 16 (since \( 2^{16} \equiv 1 \)):
   \[
   81 \mod 16 = 1

   - \( 11 = 3 \times 3 + 2 \)
   - \( 3 = 2 \times 1 + 1 \)

   From the second last step, we can express 1 as a linear combination:

2. **Calculate GCD:**  
   Compute the greatest common divisor:  
   \( \text{gcd}(5, 6) = 1 \)

3. **Find the Inverse:**  
   We need to test integer values for y:

   - For \( y = 5 \): \( 5 * 5 = 25 \equiv 1 \, (mod \, 6) \)  

   We find that \( y = 5 \) is the modular inverse of 5 modulo 6.

4. **Multiply Both Sides:**  
   Next, we multiply both sides of the original equation by the inverse (5):  
   \( 5 * (5x) ≡ 5 * 4 \, (mod \, 6) \)  
   This simplifies to:  
   \( 25x ≡ 20 \, (mod \, 6) \)

5. **Simplify the Equation:**  
   Now we simplify both sides:  
   \( 25 \, mod \, 6 = 1 \) and \( 20 \, mod \, 6 = 2 \)  
   Therefore:  
   \( 1x ≡ 2 \, (mod \, 6) \)

This means that x can be any integer of the form:  
\[ x = 2 + 6k \]  
where \( k \) is any integer (i.e., \( k ∈ \mathbb{Z} \)).",14.058411,,67a8dafd-fc10-4428-bc31-c0476f24a139,0.0,Solve 5x ≡ 4 (mod 6)
