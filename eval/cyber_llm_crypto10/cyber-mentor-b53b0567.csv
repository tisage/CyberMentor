### 2. Finding the Private Key d in RSA

Given the RSA public key \( (n, e) = (62821427, 5) \), we can find the private key \( d \) using the following steps:

1. **Factor n**: 
   - The modulus \( n = 62821427 \) can be factored into its prime components. After testing various factors, we find:
     - \( p = 7921 \)
     - \( q = 7933 \)

2. **Calculate \( \phi(n) \)**:
   - Calculate the Euler's totient function:
   \[
   \phi(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1) \\
   \phi(62821427) = (7921 - 1)(7933 - 1) = 7920 \times 7932 = 62787840
   \]

3. **Calculate the modular inverse of e**:
   - We need to find \( d \) such that:
   \[
   d \cdot e \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n) \\
   d \cdot 5 \equiv 1 \mod 62787840
   \]
   - Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find \( d \):
     - After performing the calculations, we find:
     \[
     d = 50291872
     \]

### Conclusion

1. **Calculate \( 89 \mod 4 \)**:
   - First, find the remainder when 89 is divided by 4.
   - \( 89 \div 4 = 22 \) with a remainder of \( 1 \) (because \( 4 \times 22 = 88 \) and \( 89 - 88 = 1 \)).
   - Therefore, \( 89 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \).

2. **Set up the equation**:
   - We want to solve for \( x \) in the equation:
   \[
   x + 3 \equiv 1 \mod 4
   \]

3. **Rearranging the equation**:
   - Rearranging the equation gives:
   \[
   x \equiv 1 - 3 \mod 4
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   x \equiv -2 \mod 4
   \]
   - Since \(-2\) is negative, we can convert it to a positive equivalent by adding the modulus (4):
   \[
   x \equiv -2 + 4 \mod 4 \implies x \equiv 2 \mod 4
   \]

4. **Finding the least positive value**:
   - The least positive value of \( x \) that satisfies \( x \equiv 2 \mod 4 \) is \( 2 \).

1. **Rewrite the Equation**:
   \[
   3x \equiv 2 \mod{11}

2. **Find the Modular Inverse**:
   To isolate \( x \), we need the modular inverse of \( 3 \) modulo \( 11 \). We need to find an integer \( y \) such that:
   \[
   3y \equiv 1 \mod{11}
   \]

   Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:
   - \( 11 = 3 \times 3 + 2 \)
   - \( 3 = 2 \times 1 + 1 \)
   - \( 2 = 1 \times 2 + 0 \)

   Backtracking to express \( 1 \) as a combination of \( 11 \) and \( 3 \):
   \[
   1 = 3 - 1 \times 2
   \]
   Substituting \( 2 \):
   \[
   1 = 3 - 1 \times (11 - 3 \times 3)
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   1 = 4 \times 3 - 1 \times 11
   \]

   Thus, \( 4 \) is the modular inverse of \( 3 \) modulo \( 11 \).

3. **Multiply Both Sides by the Inverse**:
   Now multiply both sides of the equation \( 3x \equiv 2 \mod{11} \) by \( 4 \):

   Since \( 12 \mod{11} \) is \( 1 \):
   \[
   x \equiv 8 \mod{11}

5. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, the solution to the equation \( 3x - 2 \equiv 0 \mod{11} \) is:

   First, we calculate \(78 \mod 5\):
   \[
   78 \mod 5 = 3

   The least positive value of \(x\) satisfying this congruence is:
   \[

2. **Finding the Remainder when \(2^{81}\) is Divided by 17**

   Using **Fermat's Little Theorem**, which states that if \(p\) is a prime and \(a\) is not divisible by \(p\), then:
   \[
   a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p
   \]

   Here, \(a = 2\) and \(p = 17\):
   \[
   2^{16} \equiv 1 \mod 17
   \]

   Now, reduce the exponent \(81\) mod \(16\):
   \[
   81 \mod 16 = 1
   \]

   Thus:
   \[
   2^{81} \equiv 2^1 \equiv 2 \mod 17

   Therefore, the remainder when \(2^{81}\) is divided by 17 is:
   \[
   \boxed{2}

3. **Finding the Least Positive Value of x such that \(71 \equiv x \mod 8\)**

   We compute:
   \[
   x \equiv 71 \mod 8

   \[
   71 \div 8 = 8 \quad \text{(remainder 7)}

   \[
   71 \mod 8 = 7

   The least positive value of \(x\) satisfying this congruence is:

### Cocks–Ellis Cryptosystem Problem

**Given:** Bob's public key \( n = 77 \).

1. **Finding Bob’s Private Key**:
   - **Factor \( n \)**:
     \[
     n = 77 = 7 \times 11
     \]
   - **Calculate \( \phi(n) \)**:
     \[
     \phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = (7-1)(11-1) = 6 \times 10 = 60
     \]
   - **Choose \( e \)**:
     For the Cocks–Ellis cryptosystem, \( e \) is typically chosen as \( 1 \).

2. **Calculate the Private Key \( d \)**:
   - The private key \( d \) is the modular inverse of \( e \) modulo \( \phi(n) \):
     Since \( e = 1 \), we have:
     \[
     d \equiv 1^{-1} \, (\text{mod} \, 60)

     Thus, \( d = 1 \).

3. **Encryption of the Message \( M = 15 \)**:
   - Using the encryption formula:
     \[
     C = M^e \mod n
     \]
     \[
     C = 15^1 \mod 77 = 15
     \]

4. **Decryption Process**:
   - Using the decryption formula:
     \[
     M' = C^d \mod n
     \]
     \[
     M' = 15^1 \mod 77 = 15

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. The function `find_least_positive_x()` encapsulates the logic to compute \( x \).
2. It calculates \( 78 \mod{5} \) and processes the equation accordingly.
3. It normalizes \( x \) to ensure it provides the least positive value.
4. Finally, it returns and prints the result.

This code will correctly compute and print the least positive value of \( x \) that satisfies the given modular equation.",24.283304,,d4b45998-72c6-4f6f-9439-db5ae274a668,1.0,Find the least positive value of x such that 78 + x ≡ 3 (mod 5)
"5x-4 = 6n for some integer n
5x-4 is a multiple of 6
x = (6n+4)/5
When we put n = 1,6,11,16… then 6n+4 is divisible by 5
If n = 1, then x = (6*1+4)/5 = 2
If n = 6, then x = (6*6+4)/5 = 8
Therefore the solutions are 2, 18, 14, 20…",test_123,"To solve the congruence equation \( 5x \equiv 4 \mod 6 \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify \( a \), \( b \), and \( m \)**:
   - Here, \( a = 5 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( m = 6 \).

2. **Check if \( \gcd(a, m) \) divides \( b \)**:
   - We need to calculate \( \gcd(5, 6) \). Since 5 and 6 are coprime, \( \gcd(5, 6) = 1 \), and since 1 divides 4, we can proceed to solve the equation.

3. **Find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 6**:
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 5y \equiv 1 \mod 6 \). Testing values:
     - \( y = 1: 5 \times 1 = 5 \equiv 5 \mod 6 \)
     - \( y = 2: 5 \times 2 = 10 \equiv 4 \mod 6 \)
     - \( y = 3: 5 \times 3 = 15 \equiv 3 \mod 6 \)
     - \( y = 4: 5 \times 4 = 20 \equiv 2 \mod 6 \)
     - \( y = 5: 5 \times 5 = 25 \equiv 1 \mod 6 \)

   Thus, the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 6 is 5.

4. **Multiply both sides of the original equation by the inverse**:
   \[
   5 \cdot 5x \equiv 5 \cdot 4 \mod 6
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   25x \equiv 20 \mod 6
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation**:
   - Since \( 25 \equiv 1 \mod 6 \) and \( 20 \equiv 2 \mod 6 \), we have:
   \[
   x \equiv 2 \mod 6
   \]

6. **Find all solutions**:
   - The general solution is given by:
   \[
   x = 2 + 6k, \quad \text{where } k \text{ is any integer.}
   \]

Therefore, the solutions to the equation \( 5x \equiv 4 \mod 6 \) are of the form \( x = 2 + 6k \) for \( k \in \mathbb{Z} \).",21.826066,,408ef650-377a-42cd-a5d7-c75e90b97b05,1.0,Solve 5x ≡ 4 (mod 6)
