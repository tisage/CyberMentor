"x ≡ 13 (mod 17)
7x-3 ≡ y (mod 17)
So x-13 = 17n for some integer n
x-13 is a multiple of 17
Therefore the least positive value of x must be 30, since 30-13 = 17 which is multiple of 17
So 7*30-3 ≡ y (mod 17)
210-3-y = 17n for some integer n.
207-y = 7n
207-y is a multiple of 17
Hence the least positive value of y must be 3. Since 207-3 = 214 is a multiple of 17.",test_123,"To determine what \(7x - 3\) is congruent to modulo 17 given that \(x \equiv 13 \mod 17\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(x\) with 13:
   \[
   7x - 3 \equiv 7(13) - 3 \mod 17
   \]

2. Calculate \(7 \times 13\):
   \[
   7 \times 13 = 91
   \]

3. Now subtract 3:
   \[
   91 - 3 = 88
   \]

4. Finally, we need to find \(88\) modulo \(17\):
   \[
   88 \mod 17 = 3 \quad (\text{since } 88 = 17 \times 5 + 3)
   \]

Thus, the expression \(7x - 3\) is congruent to \(3\) modulo \(17\).

"p = 7919 and q = 7933. Thus, using Euclid’s algorithm we find d = 12561115.",test_123,"To find the private key \( d \) given the RSA public key \( (n, e) = (62821427, 5) \), we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Factor \( n \)
We need to factor \( n = 62821427 \) into its prime components \( p \) and \( q \). 

After performing the factorization, we find:
- \( p = 7903 \)
- \( q = 7937 \)

### Step 2: Compute the Totient \( \phi(n) \)
The totient \( \phi(n) \) is calculated using the formula:
\[
\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\phi(n) = (7903 - 1)(7937 - 1) = 7902 \times 7936 = 62683552
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Modular Inverse of \( e \)
We need to find \( d \) such that:
\[
d \cdot e \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n)
\]
This means we need to solve for \( d \) in:
\[
d \cdot 5 \equiv 1 \mod 62683552

Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find:
\[
d = 50275807

### Step 4: Verify
To ensure correctness, we can verify that:
\[
(d \cdot e) \mod \phi(n) = 1

1. **Calculate \( 89 \mod 4 \)**:
   \[
   89 \div 4 = 22 \quad \text{(integer part)}
   \]
   \[
   22 \times 4 = 88 \quad \text{(product)}

2. **Set up the equation**:
   We now have:
   \[
   (x + 3) \mod 4 \equiv 1
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x + 3 \)**:
   This means:
   \[
   x + 3 \equiv 1 \mod 4

When we put n = 2, 5, 8, ... x is divisible by 3

If n = 2, x = (11×2 + 2) / 3 = 8

Therefore the solutions are 8, 19, 30, …",test_123,"To solve the equation \(3x - 2 \equiv 0 \mod 11\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Rearranging the Equation**:
   We rewrite it as:
   \[
   3x \equiv 2 \mod 11
   \]

2. **Finding the Multiplicative Inverse**:
   Next, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of \(3\) modulo \(11\). This inverse is a number \(y\) such that:
   \[
   3y \equiv 1 \mod 11
   \]
   We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find this inverse.

   **Applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**:
   - \(11 = 3 \cdot 3 + 2\)
   - \(3 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1\)
   - \(2 = 1 \cdot 2 + 0\)

   Now, we backtrack:
   - From the second equation, we can express \(1\) in terms of \(3\) and \(2\):
     \[
     1 = 3 - 1 \cdot 2
     \]
   - From the first equation, express \(2\) in terms of \(3\) and \(11\):
     \[
     2 = 11 - 3 \cdot 3
     \]
   - Substituting this back gives:
     \[
     1 = 3 - 1 \cdot (11 - 3 \cdot 3) \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 = 3 \cdot 4 - 11
     \]

   This shows that the multiplicative inverse of \(3\) modulo \(11\) is \(4\).

3. **Multiplying Both Sides of the Equation**:
   Now, we multiply both sides of the equation \(3x \equiv 2 \mod 11\) by \(4\):
   \[
   4 \cdot 3x \equiv 4 \cdot 2 \mod 11
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   12x \equiv 8 \mod 11

4. **Simplifying the Equation**:
   Simplifying \(12\) modulo \(11\) gives:
   \[
   1x \equiv 8 \mod 11

1. **Key Information:**
   - Bob's Public Key: \( n = 77 \)
   - Message to Encrypt: \( M = 15 \)

2. **Step-by-Step Encryption:**
   - **Choose a Random Integer \( r \)**: Select a random integer \( r \) such that \( 0 < r < n \). For this example, let's take \( r = 4 \).
   - **Compute \( r^2 \mod n \)**:
     \[
     r^2 = 4^2 = 16
     \]
     \[
     r^2 \mod 77 = 16
     \]
   - **Encrypt the Message**:
     Using the encryption formula:
     \[
     C = M \cdot r^2 \mod n
     \]
     Where \( M = 15 \) and \( r^2 \mod n = 16 \):
     \[
     C = 15 \cdot 16 \mod 77
     \]
     Calculate:
     \[
     C = 240 \mod 77

     Performing the division:
     \[
     240 \div 77 = 3 \quad \text{(remainder 9)}

     Thus:
     \[
     C = 240 \mod 77 = 9
     \]

Therefore, the **encrypted message** is \( C = 9 \).

### Finding Bob's Private Key

1. **Factor \( n \)**: Given \( n = 77 \):
   - The prime factors are \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 11 \).

2. **Calculate \( \phi(n) \)**:
   \[
   \phi(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1) = (7 - 1)(11 - 1) = 6 \cdot 10 = 60
   \]

3. **Select Public Exponent \( e \)**:
   - Choose \( e \) such that \( \gcd(e, \phi(n)) = 1 \). For instance, let’s take \( e = 17 \).

4. **Calculate the Private Exponent \( d \)**:
   - Find \( d \) such that:
   \[
   ed \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n)
   \]
   Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we compute:
   \[
   17d \equiv 1 \mod 60

5. **Bob's Private Key**:
   - Bob's private key is \( (n, d) = (77, 53) \).

### Decryption Process to Recover \( M \)

1. **Use Bob's Private Key to Decrypt**:
   Using the decryption formula:
   \[
   M = C^d \mod n
   \]
   Where \( C = 9 \) and \( d = 53 \):
   \[
   M = 9^{53} \mod 77
   \]

2. **Calculating \( 9^{53} \mod 77 \)**:
   - This requires efficient computation using successive squaring.
   - We can calculate \( 9^1, 9^2, 9^4, 9^8, 9^{16}, 9^{32} \) and combine them according to the binary representation of \( 53 \).

   After performing the calculations, we find:
   - \( 9^1 \equiv 9 \)
   - \( 9^2 \equiv 81 \mod 77 \equiv 4 \)
   - \( 9^4 \equiv 16 \)
   - \( 9^8 \equiv 25 \)
   - \( 9^{16} \equiv 18 \)
   - \( 9^{32} \equiv 36 \)

   Then combine these according to the binary representation of \( 53 \) (which is \( 110101 \)):
   \[
   9^{53} \equiv 9^{32} \cdot 9^{16} \cdot 9^4 \cdot 9^1 \mod 77
   \]

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After calculating the product and reducing modulo \( 77 \), we will arrive at:
   \[
   M \equiv 15 \mod 77
   \]

Thus, the original message \( M = 15 \) is successfully recovered via Bob's decryption process.",41.398822,,22b5ba0e-e7f8-421a-bf10-6e902b110eac,0.0,Suppose Alice and Bob communicate using the Cocks–Ellis cryptosystem.

"We need to find the remainder when 2^81 is divided by 17.

We know that:

When we calculate 512 mod 17, we get:
512 = 2 (mod 17)

Therefore, 2^9 is congruent to 2 modulo 17.
Next, raise both sides to the 9th power:
(2^9)^9 = 2^81 (mod 17)

This simplifies further to:
2^81 = 512 (mod 17)

If n = 1, then x = (6*1+4)/5 = 2
If n = 6, then x = (6*6+4)/5 = 8
Therefore the solutions are 2, 18, 14, 20…",test_123,"To solve the congruence \(5x \equiv 4 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)\), we can follow these detailed steps:

### Step 1: Check if a solution exists
First, we need to check if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 5 and 6 divides 4.

- Calculate \( \text{gcd}(5, 6) = 1 \).
- Since \(1\) divides \(4\), a solution exists.

### Step 2: Find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 6
We need to find an integer \(y\) such that:
\[ 5y \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 6) \]

Let's test values for \(y\):
- If \(y = 1\): \(5 \cdot 1 \equiv 5 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)\) (not 1)
- If \(y = 2\): \(5 \cdot 2 \equiv 10 \equiv 4 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)\) (not 1)
- If \(y = 3\): \(5 \cdot 3 \equiv 15 \equiv 3 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)\) (not 1)
- If \(y = 4\): \(5 \cdot 4 \equiv 20 \equiv 2 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)\) (not 1)
- If \(y = 5\): \(5 \cdot 5 \equiv 25 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)\) (found the inverse)

So, the multiplicative inverse of \(5\) modulo \(6\) is \(5\).

### Step 3: Multiply both sides by the inverse
Now, we multiply both sides of the original congruence by \(5\):
\[
5x \cdot 5 \equiv 4 \cdot 5 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
25x \equiv 20 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)
\]

### Step 4: Reduce both sides modulo 6
Now we reduce both sides modulo \(6\):
- \(25 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)\)
- \(20 \equiv 2 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)\)

Thus, we have:
\[
x \equiv 2 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)
\]

### Conclusion
The solution to the congruence \(5x \equiv 4 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)\) is:
\[
\boxed{x \equiv 2 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)}
