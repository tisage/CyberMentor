1. **Given**: \( x \equiv 13 \mod 17 \)
2. **Substitute** \( x \) into the expression \( 7x - 3 \):
   \[
   7x - 3 \equiv 7(13) - 3 \mod 17

### Problem 2: Finding the RSA Private Key \( d \)

Given the RSA public key \( (n, e) = (62821427, 5) \), we need to find the private key \( d \).

**Steps to Solve:**

1. **Factor \( n \)**:
   - We need to find two prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) such that:
     \[
     n = p \times q
     \]
   - After factorization, we find:
     - \( p = 7919 \)
     - \( q = 7933 \)

2. **Calculate \( \phi(n) \)**:
   - The totient function \( \phi(n) \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \phi(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)
     \]
   - This gives:
     \[
     \phi(62821427) = (7919 - 1)(7933 - 1) = 7918 \times 7932 = 62731856
     \]

3. **Calculate \( d \)**:
   - We need to find \( d \) such that:
     \[
     d \times e \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n)
     \]
   - This translates to:
     \[
     d \times 5 \equiv 1 \mod 62731856
     \]
   - Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we determine that:
     \[
     d = 50215443
     \]

**Conclusion:**
Thus, the private key \( d \) is \( 50215443 \).",28.108246,,a9de9136-a67e-44fb-91b1-3e24e50d9246,1.0,"Given the RSA public key (n, e) = (62821427, 5) find the private key d. (You may suppose that the public key was chosen insecurely.)"
"89 ≡ (x+3) (mod 4)
89-(x+3) = 4n for some integer n

86-x is a multiple of 4
Therefore the least positive value of x must be 2. Since 86-2 = 84 is the nearest multiple of 4 less than 86.",test_123,"To solve the congruence equation \( 89 \equiv (x + 3) \mod 4 \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate \( 89 \mod 4 \)**:
   \[
   89 \div 4 = 22.25 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Remainder} = 89 - 4 \times 22 = 1
   \]
   Thus, \( 89 \mod 4 = 1 \).

2. **Set up the equivalence**:
   \[
   (x + 3) \mod 4 \equiv 1
   \]
   This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   x + 3 \equiv 1 \mod 4
   \]

3. **Rearranging the equation**:
   \[
   x \equiv 1 - 3 \mod 4
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x \equiv -2 \mod 4
   \]

4. **Convert \(-2\) into a positive equivalent**:
   To find the least positive equivalent of \(-2 \mod 4\), we add \(4\):
   \[
   -2 + 4 = 2
   \]
   Thus, \( x \equiv 2 \mod 4 \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   The least positive value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation is:
   \[
   \boxed{2}
   \]

This value can be verified by substituting back into the original equation:
- \( x + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 \)
- Checking: \( 5 \mod 4 = 1 \), which matches \( 89 \mod 4 = 1 \). 

Thus, the solution is confirmed: \( x = 2 \).",19.479359,,dd9965d1-e9d0-468c-b4ab-386eb1868ce6,1.0,Find the least positive value of x such that 89 ≡ (x + 3) (mod 4)

3x - 2 is a multiple of 11

Therefore the solutions are 8, 19, 30, …",test_123,"To solve the equation \(3x - 2 \equiv 0 \mod{11}\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Rewrite the equation**:
   \[
   3x \equiv 2 \mod{11}
   \]

2. **Find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11**:
   We need to determine the integer \(y\) such that:
   \[
   3y \equiv 1 \mod{11}
   \]

   We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find this inverse.

   - Compute the gcd using the Euclidean algorithm:
     - \(11 = 3 \times 3 + 2\)
     - \(3 = 2 \times 1 + 1\)
     - \(2 = 1 \times 2 + 0\)
     
     Thus, \(\gcd(3, 11) = 1\), meaning an inverse exists.

   - Now, express \(1\) as a linear combination of \(3\) and \(11\):
     - From the second step above:
       \[
       1 = 3 - 1 \times (11 - 3 \times 3) = 3 \times 4 - 11 \times 1
       \]
     Hence, the multiplicative inverse of \(3\) modulo \(11\) is \(4\).

3. **Multiply both sides of the equation \(3x \equiv 2\) by the inverse (4)**:
   \[
   4 \cdot 3x \equiv 4 \cdot 2 \mod{11}
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   12x \equiv 8 \mod{11}
   \]

4. **Simplify \(12 \mod{11}\)**:
   \[
   x \equiv 8 \mod{11}

### 2. Remainder when \( 2^{81} \) is divided by 17

**Solution Steps:**
To find the remainder of \( 2^{81} \) when divided by \( 17 \), we can use **Fermat's Little Theorem**, which states that if \( p \) is a prime and \( a \) is not divisible by \( p \), then:
\[
a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } p)
\]

1. Here, let \( p = 17 \) and \( a = 2 \).
2. Calculate \( p - 1 \):
   \[
   p - 1 = 17 - 1 = 16
   \]
3. According to Fermat's Little Theorem:
   \[
   2^{16} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 17)
   \]
4. We want to find \( 2^{81} \mod 17 \). Express \( 81 \) in terms of \( 16 \):
   \[
   81 = 16 \times 5 + 1
   \]
5. Rewrite \( 2^{81} \):
   \[
   2^{81} = (2^{16})^5 \times 2^1 \equiv 1^5 \times 2 \equiv 2 \, (\text{mod } 17)

The remainder when \( 2^{81} \) is divided by \( 17 \) is **2**.

2. Thus, 
   \[

**Final Answer:**
The least positive value of \( x \) is **7**.

### Problem 2: Cocks-Ellis Cryptosystem

Given Bob’s public key \( n = 77 \) and the message \( M = 15 \):

#### Part 1: Finding Bob's Private Key

1. **Determine \( p \) and \( q \)**:
   \[
   n = 77 \Rightarrow p = 7, \ q = 11 \quad (\text{since } 7 \times 11 = 77)
   \]

2. **Compute \( \lambda(n) \)**:
   \[
   \lambda(n) = \text{lcm}(p-1, q-1) = \text{lcm}(6, 10) = 30
   \]

3. **Find Bob's Private Key**:
   We assume the public exponent \( e = 3 \):
   \[
   d \cdot e \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ \lambda(n))
   \]
   \[
   d \cdot 3 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ 30)
   \]
   Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:
   \[
   1 = 10 \cdot 3 - 1 \cdot 30
   \]
   Thus, \( d = 10 \) is the private key since \( 10 \cdot 3 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ 30) \).

#### Part 2: Encrypting the Message \( M = 15 \)

4. **Encryption of \( M \)**:
   \[
   C \equiv M^e \ (\text{mod} \ n)
   \]
   \[
   C \equiv 15^3 \ (\text{mod} \ 77)
   \]
   Calculate \( 15^3 \):
   \[
   15^3 = 3375
   \]
   Now reduce it modulo 77:
   \[
   C \equiv 3375 \mod 77 = 26
   \]

#### Part 3: Decrypting the Message

5. **Decrypting \( C = 26 \)** using \( d = 10 \):
   \[
   M' \equiv C^d \ (\text{mod} \ n)
   \]
   \[
   M' \equiv 26^{10} \ (\text{mod} \ 77)
   \]
   Using successive squaring:
   - \( 26^2 = 676 \mod 77 = 65 \)
   - \( 26^4 = 65^2 = 4225 \mod 77 = 36 \)
   - \( 26^8 = 36^2 = 1296 \mod 77 = 25 \)

   Now combine:
   \[
   26^{10} = 26^8 \cdot 26^2 = 25 \cdot 65 = 1625 \mod 77 = 11

4. **Determine the least positive value of \( x \)**:
   - The least positive value of \( x \) that satisfies this congruence is:
   \[
   x = 5k \quad \text{for } k = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 5
   \]

Therefore, the least positive value of \( x \) such that \( 78 + x \equiv 3 \mod 5 \) is **5**.",14.159337,,ce5c526d-0513-4b50-86cf-4b43f213d14e,1.0,Find the least positive value of x such that 78 + x ≡ 3 (mod 5)
"5x-4 = 6n for some integer n
5x-4 is a multiple of 6
x = (6n+4)/5
When we put n = 1,6,11,16… then 6n+4 is divisible by 5
If n = 1, then x = (6*1+4)/5 = 2
If n = 6, then x = (6*6+4)/5 = 8
Therefore the solutions are 2, 18, 14, 20…",test_123,"To solve the equation \( 5x \equiv 4 \, (\text{mod} \, 6) \), we follow these steps:

1. **Identify the coefficients:** Here, \( a = 5 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( n = 6 \).

2. **Check if \( a \) and \( n \) are coprime:** We need the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 5 and 6. Since \( \text{gcd}(5, 6) = 1 \), 5 has an inverse modulo 6.

3. **Find the modular inverse of \( a \):** We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 5y \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 6) \).
   - Testing values:
     - For \( y = 1: 5 \times 1 = 5 \equiv 5 \, (\text{mod} \, 6) \)
     - For \( y = 2: 5 \times 2 = 10 \equiv 4 \, (\text{mod} \, 6) \)
     - For \( y = 3: 5 \times 3 = 15 \equiv 3 \, (\text{mod} \, 6) \)
     - For \( y = 4: 5 \times 4 = 20 \equiv 2 \, (\text{mod} \, 6) \)
     - For \( y = 5: 5 \times 5 = 25 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 6) \)

   Thus, the modular inverse of 5 modulo 6 is 5.

4. **Multiply both sides of the original equation by the modular inverse:**
   \[
   5x \times 5 \equiv 4 \times 5 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   25x \equiv 20 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)
   \]

5. **Reduce both sides modulo 6:**
   \[
   25 \mod 6 = 1, \quad \text{and} \quad 20 \mod 6 = 2
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   1x \equiv 2 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The solution to the equation \( 5x \equiv 4 \, (\text{mod} \, 6) \) is:
   \[
   x \equiv 2 \, (\text{mod} \, 6)
   \]
   Therefore, the solution is \( x = 2 \).",21.4827,,2c9fb49c-e576-4fe6-9818-48705c6ed182,1.0,Solve 5x ≡ 4 (mod 6)
