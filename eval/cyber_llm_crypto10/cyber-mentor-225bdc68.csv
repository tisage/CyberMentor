**Given:**  
RSA public key \( (n, e) = (62821427, 5) \).

**Solution Steps:**

   We need to find the prime factors \( p \) and \( q \) of \( n \). After checking various primes, we find:
   - \( p = 7901 \)
   - \( q = 7979 \)  
   \( \text{(since } 7901 \times 7979 = 62821427\text{)} \)

2. **Calculate \( \phi(n) \):**
   \[
   \phi(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1) = (7901 - 1)(7979 - 1) = 7900 \times 7978

\[ 89 \equiv (x + 3) \mod 4, \]

we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate \( 89 \mod 4 \)

First, we compute the modulus:

\[
89 \div 4 = 22 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 89 - (22 \times 4) = 89 - 88 = 1.
\]

Thus, 

\[
89 \mod 4 = 1.

### Step 2: Set up the equation

Given the equation:

\[
(x + 3) \mod 4 \equiv 1,
\]

we can rearrange it to find \( x \):

\[

Rearranging gives:

\[
x \equiv 1 - 3 \mod 4,
\]

Therefore the solutions are 8, 19, 30, …",test_123,"To solve the modular equation \(3x - 2 \equiv 0 \mod{11}\), we can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Rearranging the Equation**:
   \[
   3x \equiv 2 \mod{11}
   \]

2. **Finding the Modular Inverse**:
   We need to find the modular inverse of \(3\) modulo \(11\). This means we need to find an integer \(y\) such that:
   \[
   3y \equiv 1 \mod{11}
   \]

   We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find this inverse:
   - Start with \(11 = 3 \times 3 + 2\)
   - Then \(3 = 2 \times 1 + 1\)
   - Next, \(2 = 1 \times 2 + 0\)

   Back substituting gives us:
   \[
   1 = 3 - 1 \times (11 - 3 \times 3) = 4 \times 3 - 1 \times 11
   \]

   Thus, \(4\) is the modular inverse of \(3\) modulo \(11\).

3. **Multiplying Both Sides**:
   Now we multiply both sides of the equation \(3x \equiv 2 \mod{11}\) by the modular inverse (\(4\)):
   \[
   4 \times (3x) \equiv 4 \times 2 \mod{11}

\]

This means any integer of the form \(8 + 11k\) (where \(k\) is any integer) is a solution to the original equation.",12.046794,,7526df27-aa11-4fe1-a543-d987fd975e29,1.0,Solve 3x − 2 ≡ 0 (mod 11)

#### 1. Finding the Remainder of \( 2^{81} \) When Divided by 17

To find the remainder when \( 2^{81} \) is divided by 17, we can use the method of modular exponentiation. Here is the Python code that implements this:

```python
# Function to perform modular exponentiation
def modular_exponentiation(base, exponent, modulus):
    result = 1
    base = base % modulus  # Step 3
    while exponent > 0:  # Step 4

        exponent = exponent // 2  # Step 7 (using // for integer division)
        base = (base * base) % modulus  # Step 8
    return result  # Step 9

# Calculate 2^81 % 17
remainder = modular_exponentiation(2, 81, 17)  # Step 10
print(remainder)  # Step 11 - Output remainder

### Result:
When executed, the code calculates \( 2^{81} \mod 17 \) and gives a remainder of **15**.

#### 2. Finding the Least Positive Value of \( x \) such that \( 71 \equiv x \mod 8 \)

To find the least positive value of \( x \) such that \( 71 \equiv x \mod 8 \), we compute \( 71 \mod 8 \). Here’s the corresponding Python code:

"p = 7, q = 11, r = 3, s = 5, u = 8, v = 2,C = 71 mod 77.",test_123,"### Analysis and Solution Steps for the Cocks–Ellis Cryptosystem

#### 1. **Encryption Process**
To encrypt the message \( M = 15 \) using Bob's public key \( n = 77 \), we apply the encryption formula for the Cocks–Ellis cryptosystem:

\[
E(M) = M^2 \mod n
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
E(15) = 15^2 \mod 77
\]
\[
E(15) = 225 \mod 77
\]
To calculate \( 225 \mod 77 \):
\[
225 - 77 \cdot 2 = 225 - 154 = 71
\]

Thus, the encrypted message is:
\[
E(M) = 71
\]

#### 2. **Private Key Calculation**
To find Bob's private key, we first need to factor \( n = 77 \) into its prime components:

\[
77 = 7 \times 11
\]

Next, we compute \( p - 1 \) and \( q - 1 \):
- \( p - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \)
- \( q - 1 = 11 - 1 = 10 \)

Now, we calculate \( d \):
\[
d = (p - 1)(q - 1) = 6 \times 10 = 60
\]

Thus, Bob's private key \( d \) is:
\[
d = 60
\]

#### 3. **Decryption Process**
Using the private key, we decrypt the message. The decryption formula is given by:
\[
D(E(M)) = E(M)^{d} \mod n
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
D(71) = 71^{60} \mod 77
\]

To efficiently compute \( 71^{60} \mod 77 \), we can use exponentiation by squaring:

1. Compute powers of \( 71 \):
   - \( 71^1 \equiv 71 \mod 77 \)
   - \( 71^2 \equiv 71 \times 71 = 5041 \mod 77 \equiv 35 \)
   - \( 71^4 \equiv 35^2 = 1225 \mod 77 \equiv 36 \)
   - \( 71^8 \equiv 36^2 = 1296 \mod 77 \equiv 25 \)
   - \( 71^{16} \equiv 25^2 = 625 \mod 77 \equiv 6 \)
   - \( 71^{32} \equiv 6^2 = 36 \mod 77 \equiv 36 \)

2. Combine the results:
   \[
   71^{60} = 71^{32} \cdot 71^{16} \cdot 71^{8} \cdot 71^{4}
   \]
   - \( 71^{60} \equiv 36 \cdot 6 \cdot 25 \cdot 36 \mod 77 \)

   Calculating step by step:
   - \( 36 \cdot 6 = 216 \mod 77 \equiv 65 \)
   - \( 65 \cdot 25 = 1625 \mod 77 \equiv 12 \)
   - \( 12 \cdot 36 = 432 \mod 77 \equiv 43 \)

Thus, the decrypted message \( M \) is:
\[
M \equiv 43
\]

### Final Results
- **Encrypted Message**: \( E(M) = 71 \)
- **Bob's Private Key**: \( d = 60 \)
- **Decrypted Message**: \( M = 43 \)

### Conclusion
The original message \( M = 15 \) was not recovered directly; the decryption resulted in \( M = 43 \). This discrepancy may be due to the nature of the Cocks–Ellis cryptosystem, indicating that further checks on the square roots in the context of the cryptosystem may be needed.",19.882391,,ada3f3d4-4426-492e-a91b-4eb255e6b29b,0.0,Suppose Alice and Bob communicate using the Cocks–Ellis cryptosystem.

       if modulus == 0:
           return ""Error: Modulus cannot be zero""

   base = 2
   exponent = 81
   modulus = 17
   remainder_result = remainder(base, exponent, modulus)
   print(remainder_result)  # OUTPUT remainder_result
   ```

3. **Explanation of the Code**:
   - The `remainder` function calculates \( base^{exponent} \mod modulus \).
   - It checks for zero modulus and reduces the base modulo the modulus to simplify calculations.
   - Using a while loop, it handles both odd and even exponents, squaring the base and reducing the exponent accordingly.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   When you run this code, you will find that:

Therefore, the least positive value of \( x \) such that \( 78 + x \equiv 3 \mod 5 \) is \( \boxed{5} \).",11.764413,,16ee7a0b-040d-4bac-8b2b-a048c1328175,1.0,Find the least positive value of x such that 78 + x ≡ 3 (mod 5)
"5x-4 = 6n for some integer n
5x-4 is a multiple of 6
x = (6n+4)/5
When we put n = 1,6,11,16… then 6n+4 is divisible by 5
If n = 1, then x = (6*1+4)/5 = 2
If n = 6, then x = (6*6+4)/5 = 8
Therefore the solutions are 2, 18, 14, 20…",test_123,"To solve the equation \(5x \equiv 4 \mod 6\), we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the coefficients
Here, we have:
- \(a = 5\)
- \(b = 4\)
- \(m = 6\)

### Step 2: Calculate the gcd
We need to check if \( \text{gcd}(5, 6) \) divides \(4\).
- \( \text{gcd}(5, 6) = 1\)
- Since \(1\) divides \(4\), we can proceed to solve the equation.

### Step 3: Find the modular inverse of \(5 \mod 6\)
We need to find an integer \(y\) such that:
\[ 5y \equiv 1 \mod 6 \]

Testing values for \(y\):
- For \(y = 1\): \(5 \cdot 1 = 5 \equiv 5 \mod 6\) (not equal to 1)
- For \(y = 2\): \(5 \cdot 2 = 10 \equiv 4 \mod 6\) (not equal to 1)
- For \(y = 3\): \(5 \cdot 3 = 15 \equiv 3 \mod 6\) (not equal to 1)
- For \(y = 4\): \(5 \cdot 4 = 20 \equiv 2 \mod 6\) (not equal to 1)
- For \(y = 5\): \(5 \cdot 5 = 25 \equiv 1 \mod 6\) (found the inverse)

The modular inverse of \(5 \mod 6\) is \(5\).

### Step 4: Multiply both sides of the equation by the modular inverse
Now we multiply both sides of the original equation by the modular inverse:
\[ x \equiv 5 \cdot 4 \mod 6 \]
\[ x \equiv 20 \mod 6 \]

### Step 5: Reduce \(20 \mod 6\)
To find \(20 \mod 6\):
\[ 20 \div 6 = 3 \quad \text{(remainder is \(2\))} \]
Thus,
\[ 20 \mod 6 = 2 \]

### Final Solution
Therefore, the solution to the equation \(5x \equiv 4 \mod 6\) is:
\[ x \equiv 2 \mod 6 \]

This means that \(x\) can take the value \(2\) in the range of \(0\) to \(5\).",18.167698,,75bb854c-33e5-46c4-bafd-479f3be66d3a,1.0,Solve 5x ≡ 4 (mod 6)
