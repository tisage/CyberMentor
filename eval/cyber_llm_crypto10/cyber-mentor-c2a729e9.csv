Given that \( x \equiv 13 \mod{17} \), we need to find the value of \( 7x - 3 \mod{17} \).

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Substitute \( x \)**:
   \[
   7x - 3 \equiv 7(13) - 3 \mod{17}
   \]

2. **Calculate \( 7 \times 13 \)**:
   \[
   7 \times 13 = 91
   \]

3. **Subtract 3**:
   \[
   91 - 3 = 88
   \]

4. **Now find \( 88 \mod{17} \)**:
   - Divide \( 88 \) by \( 17 \):
   \[
   88 \div 17 = 5 \quad \text{(since } 17 \times 5 = 85\text{)}
   \]
   - Find the remainder:
   \[
   88 - 85 = 3

"p = 7919 and q = 7933. Thus, using Euclid’s algorithm we find d = 12561115.",test_123,"To find the private key \( d \) for the RSA public key \( (n, e) = (62821427, 5) \), we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Factor \( n \)
First, we need to factor \( n \) into its prime components \( p \) and \( q \):
- Through trial division or other factorization methods, we find that:
  \[
  n = 62821427 = 7907 \times 7973
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \phi(n) \)
Next, we calculate \( \phi(n) \) using the formula:
\[
\phi(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)
\]
- Here, \( p = 7907 \) and \( q = 7973 \):
  \[
  \phi(n) = (7907 - 1)(7973 - 1) = 7906 \times 7972 = 62818434

### Step 3: Calculate \( d \)
Now, we need to find \( d \) such that:
\[
d \cdot e \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n)
\]
- Given \( e = 5 \), we need to find the modular inverse of \( e \) modulo \( \phi(n) \).

### Step 4: Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm
We apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \( d \):
- Let \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 62818434 \):
1. Start the algorithm:
   \[
   62818434 = 5 \cdot 12563686 + 4
   \]
   \[
   5 = 4 \cdot 1 + 1
   \]
   \[
   4 = 1 \cdot 4 + 0
   \]
2. Back substitute to find coefficients:
   \[
   1 = 5 - 1 \cdot (62818434 - 5 \cdot 12563686)
   \]
   \[
   1 = 5 \cdot 12563687 - 1 \cdot 62818434

   \]
   \[
   89 - (22 \times 4) = 89 - 88 = 1
   \]
   Thus, \( 89 \mod 4 = 1 \).

2. **Set up the congruence**:
   We need to solve the equation:
   \[
   (x + 3) \mod 4 \equiv 1
   \]
   This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   x + 3 \equiv 1 \mod 4

   \[
   x \equiv 1 - 3 \mod 4

### Step 1: Rearranging the Equation
We can rearrange the equation:

\]

### Step 2: Finding the Multiplicative Inverse
Next, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of \(3\) modulo \(11\). The multiplicative inverse \(y\) satisfies:
\[
3y \equiv 1 \mod{11}
\]

We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for this.

### Step 3: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: This algorithm helps us find \(x\) and \(y\) such that:
   \[
   3x + 11y = \text{gcd}(3, 11)
   \]
   Since \(gcd(3, 11) = 1\), the inverse exists.

2. **Inverse Calculation**:
   - Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find:
   \[
   3 \cdot 4 \equiv 12 \equiv 1 \mod{11}
   \]
   Hence, \(4\) is the multiplicative inverse of \(3\) modulo \(11\).

### Step 4: Multiply by the Inverse
Now, we can multiply both sides of the original equation \(3x \equiv 2 \mod{11}\) by \(4\):
\[
x \equiv 2 \cdot 4 \mod{11}

Calculating that gives:
\[
x \equiv 8 \mod{11}

### Final Solution
Thus, the solution to the equation \(3x - 2 \equiv 0 \mod{11}\) is:
\[

### Verification
To verify, we can substitute \(x = 8\) back into the original equation:
\[
3(8) - 2 = 24 - 2 = 22

Now check \(22 \mod{11}\):
\[
22 \equiv 0 \mod{11}

#### 1. Solve \( 3x - 2 \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ 11) \)

**Analysis:**
- This is a modular linear equation of the form \( ax \equiv b \ (\text{mod} \ m) \), where \( a = 3 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( m = 11 \).
- Finding the solution involves isolating \( x \) and determining the multiplicative inverse of \( a \) modulo \( m \).

**Steps:**
1. Rearrange the equation:
   \[

2. Find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11. We need an integer \( y \) such that:
   \[
   3y \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ 11)

   Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:
   - \( 11 = 3 \times 3 + 2 \)
   - \( 3 = 2 \times 1 + 1 \)
   - \( 2 = 1 \times 2 + 0 \)
   Backtracking gives:
   - \( 1 = 3 - 2 \times 1 \)
   - Substitute \( 2 \): \( 1 = 3 - (11 - 3 \times 3) \)
   - Simplifying, we find: \( 1 = 4 \times 3 - 11 \)
   Thus, the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11 is \( 4 \).

3. Multiply both sides by the inverse:

**Steps:**
1. Perform the division:
   \[
   71 \div 8 = 8 \quad \text{(quotient)}

   \[
   8 \times 8 = 64

#### Given:
- Bob’s public key: \( n = 77 \)
- Message \( M = 15 \)

### Step 1: Factor the Public Key
To find Bob's private key, we need to factor \( n \):
- \( n = 77 = 7 \times 11 \) 
- Thus, \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 11 \).

### Step 2: Calculate Bob's Private Key
Using the factors, we compute the Euler's totient function \( \phi(n) \):
- \( \phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = (7-1)(11-1) = 6 \times 10 = 60 \).

In the Cocks-Ellis cryptosystem, we typically choose \( e = 1 \), making:
- \( d = 1 \) (the private key).

### Step 3: Encrypt the Message
The encryption of the message \( M = 15 \) is calculated using:
\[ c = M^2 \mod n \]
Calculating:
\[ c = 15^2 \mod 77 \]
\[ c = 225 \mod 77 \]
Finding \( 225 \div 77 \):
- \( 225 - 2 \times 77 = 225 - 154 = 71 \)
Thus,
- **Encrypted message**: \( c = 71 \).

### Step 4: Decrypt the Message
To decrypt \( c \), we need to find \( M \) such that:
\[ M = \sqrt{c} \mod n \]
We check the squares of potential integers:
- \( 1^2 = 1 \)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( 3^2 = 9 \)
- \( 4^2 = 16 \)
- \( 5^2 = 25 \)
- \( 6^2 = 36 \)
- \( 7^2 = 49 \)
- \( 8^2 = 64 \)
- \( 9^2 = 81 \mod 77 = 4 \)
- \( 10^2 = 100 \mod 77 = 23 \)
- \( 11^2 = 121 \mod 77 = 44 \)
- \( 12^2 = 144 \mod 77 = 67 \)
- \( 13^2 = 169 \mod 77 = 15 \)
- \( 14^2 = 196 \mod 77 = 22 \)
- \( 15^2 = 225 \mod 77 = 71 \)

From our calculations:
- **Decrypted message**: \( M = 15 \).

Therefore, 2^9 is congruent to 2 modulo 17.
Next, raise both sides to the 9th power:

This simplifies further to:
2^81 = 512 (mod 17)

### Problem 2: Rabin's Cryptosystem

**Analysis:**
- **Key Topic:** Rabin's Cryptosystem
- **Key Knowledge:** Rabin's cryptosystem is a public-key cryptographic system based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. Given the public key \( n = pq \), the cryptogram \( C \), and the structure of the system, we can find possible plaintext messages by solving the equation \( m^2 \equiv C \, (\text{mod} \, n) \).
- **Knowledge Unit:** Quadratic Residues
- **Importance:** Understanding quadratic residues is crucial in Rabin's cryptosystem, as the security relies on the difficulty of determining square roots modulo \( n \), which is essential for decryption.

**Solution:**
To find the four possible messages that correspond to the cryptogram \( C = 71 \) in Rabin's cryptosystem with public key \( n = 77 \), we follow these steps:

1. **Identify primes \( p \) and \( q \):**
   Given \( n = 77 \), we can factor it into primes: \( n = 7 \times 11 \), where \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 11 \).

2. **Compute the quadratic residues modulo \( p \) and \( q \):**
   - For \( p = 7 \), the quadratic residues are:
     - \( 0^2 \equiv 0 \) mod 7
     - \( 1^2 \equiv 1 \) mod 7
     - \( 2^2 \equiv 4 \) mod 7
     - \( 3^2 \equiv 2 \) mod 7
     - \( 4^2 \equiv 2 \) mod 7 (since \( 4 \equiv 3 \) mod 7)
     - \( 5^2 \equiv 4 \) mod 7 (since \( 5 \equiv 2 \) mod 7)
     - \( 6^2 \equiv 1 \) mod 7 (since \( 6 \equiv 1 \) mod 7)
   Thus, the quadratic residues mod 7 are: **0, 1, 2, 4**.

   - For \( q = 11 \), the quadratic residues are:
     - \( 0^2 \equiv 0 \) mod 11
     - \( 1^2 \equiv 1 \) mod 11
     - \( 2^2 \equiv 4 \) mod 11
     - \( 3^2 \equiv 9 \) mod 11
     - \( 4^2 \equiv 5 \) mod 11
     - \( 5^2 \equiv 3 \) mod 11
     - \( 6^2 \equiv 3 \) mod 11 (since \( 6 \equiv 5 \) mod 11)
     - \( 7^2 \equiv 5 \) mod 11 (since \( 7 \equiv 4 \) mod 11)
     - \( 8^2 \equiv 9 \) mod 11 (since \( 8 \equiv 3 \) mod 11)
     - \( 9^2 \equiv 4 \) mod 11 (since \( 9 \equiv 2 \) mod 11)
     - \( 10^2 \equiv 1 \) mod 11 (since \( 10 \equiv 1 \) mod 11)
   Thus, the quadratic residues mod 11 are: **0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9**.

3. **Check if \( C \) is a quadratic residue modulo \( p \) and \( q \):**
   - For \( C = 71 \) mod 7:
     \[
     71 \mod 7 = 1 \quad (\text{which is a quadratic residue})
     \]
   - For \( C = 71 \) mod 11:
     \[
     71 \mod 11 = 6 \quad (\text{which is not a quadratic residue})
     \]

4. **Find square roots for \( C \) modulo \( p \) and \( q \):**
   Since \( C \) is a quadratic residue mod 7 but not mod 11, we cannot find a valid \( m \) that satisfies the equation \( m^2 \equiv C \) mod \( n \). In Rabin's scheme, this means that the system does not yield valid messages from this cryptogram.

**Conclusion:**
Given that the quadratic residue checks failed, we conclude that Bob cannot decrypt the cryptogram \( C = 71 \) under the current parameters.",33.528589,,30b0b5b2-63fe-4f05-be12-191da3f7b739,0.0,Bob uses Rabin’s cryptosystem with public key n = 77.

**Key Knowledge:** A linear congruence of the form \(ax \equiv b \mod m\) can be solved for \(x\) by finding an integer \(k\) such that \(ax - b = km\) for some integer \(k\). The solution exists if \(\gcd(a, m)\) divides \(b\).  
**Knowledge Unit:** Linear Congruences  
**Importance:** Solving linear congruences is fundamental in number theory and has practical applications in cryptography, coding theory, and algorithm design.

### Solution Steps
1. **Identify the coefficients:**  
   In this case, \(a = 5\), \(b = 4\), and \(m = 6\).

2. **Check the solvability condition:**  
   Calculate \(\gcd(5, 6)\). Since 5 and 6 are coprime (\(\gcd(5, 6) = 1\)), we need to check if 1 divides 4. It does, so a solution exists.

3. **Find the inverse of \(a\) modulo \(m\):**  
   We need to find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 6. We want to find an integer \(y\) such that \(5y \equiv 1 \mod 6\).  
   Testing integers, we find that:
   \[
   5 \cdot 5 \equiv 25 \equiv 1 \mod 6
   \]
   Thus, the inverse is 5.

4. **Multiply both sides of the congruence by the inverse:**  
   Multiply the original equation by 5 to isolate \(x\):
   \[
   5 \cdot 5x \equiv 5 \cdot 4 \mod 6
   \]
   \[
   25x \equiv 20 \mod 6
   \]

5. **Reduce the result modulo 6:**  
   Calculate \(20 \mod 6\):
   \[
   20 \equiv 2 \mod 6
   \]

### Final Result
Thus, the solution to the congruence \(5x \equiv 4 \mod 6\) is:
\[
x \equiv 2 \mod 6
\]
This means the complete solution is:
\[
x = 2 + 6k \quad \text{for any integer } k.
