# Model Evaluation Across Different Question Source
Our evaluation utilized a dataset of 115 cybersecurity-related questions across three domains: knowledge-based, cryptography, and coding. These questions were sourced from industry-standard repositories, academic exercises, and practical problem-solving tasks. The diversity in question types ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the model's proficiency in both theoretical knowledge and technical skills.
