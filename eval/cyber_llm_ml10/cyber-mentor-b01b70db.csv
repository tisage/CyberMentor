"World Health Organization has estimated that four out of five cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths are due to heart attacks. This whole research intends to pinpoint the ratio of patients who possess a good chance of being affected by CVD and also to predict the overall risk using Logistic Regression.

What is Logistic Regression?
Logistic Regression is a statistical and machine-learning technique classifying records of a dataset based on the values of the input fields. It predicts a dependent variable based on one or more sets of independent variables to predict outcomes. It can be used both for binary classification and multi-class classification.

#### 1. Problem Formulation:
   - **Nature of the Problem**: This is a **supervised learning** problem, specifically a **binary classification** task where we want to predict the likelihood of a patient developing coronary heart disease (CVD) over a ten-year period.
   - **Dataset Name**: `framingham.csv`
   - **Features**: 
     - `age`: Age of the patient
     - `Sex_male`: Gender (binary indicator for male)
     - `cigsPerDay`: Number of cigarettes smoked per day
     - `totChol`: Total cholesterol level
     - `sysBP`: Systolic blood pressure
     - `glucose`: Glucose level
   - **Target Value**: `TenYearCHD`: Indicator of whether the patient has coronary heart disease (1) or not (0).

#### 2. Data Processing:
   - **Data Cleaning**: 
     - Drop the column `education` as it is not required.
     - Handle missing values by removing any rows containing NaN/NULL values.
   - **Feature Engineering**: 
     - Rename the `male` column to `Sex_male` for clarity.
   - **Standardization**: Normalize the features using `StandardScaler` to improve the model performance.
   - **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets to evaluate the model's performance.

#### 3. Model Selection:
   - **Recommended Algorithm**: Logistic Regression is chosen for this binary classification problem due to its effectiveness and interpretability.

### Python Code Implementation

Below is the Python code that implements the above analysis to build a Logistic Regression model for predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load the dataset
file_path = 'framingham.csv'  # Ensure the correct path to your dataset
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Data Cleaning
# Drop unnecessary columns
data = data.drop(columns=['education'], errors='ignore')
# Remove rows with NaN values
data = data.dropna()

# Feature Engineering
# Rename the male column
data.rename(columns={'male': 'Sex_male'}, inplace=True)

# Define features and target
X = data[['age', 'Sex_male', 'cigsPerDay', 'totChol', 'sysBP', 'glucose']]
Y = data['TenYearCHD']

# Standardization
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Data Splitting
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, Y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Model Selection
model = LogisticRegression()
# Fit the model
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Predictions
Y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(Y_test, Y_pred)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(Y_test, Y_pred)
class_report = classification_report(Y_test, Y_pred)

# Output results
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
print('Confusion Matrix:')
print(conf_matrix)
print('Classification Report:')
print(class_report)
```

### Output Interpretation
- **Accuracy**: Represents the proportion of true results among the total number of cases examined.

Now anayze the data, write Python code to build up machine learning model"
"Now let us load the dataset in the panda’s data frame. One can download the CSV file from here.

Now, let’s check the correlation

Converting the string date & time in proper date & time format with the help of pandas. After that check is there any null value is present or not.

Now, let’s check for the presence of null values in the dataset.

Dropping those missing values so that we do not have any errors while analyzing.

Now, check the statistical analysis of the data using describe() method.

Now, firstly we will analyze the closing price as we need it to perform the prediction.

The column ‘Close’ is our predicted feature. We are taking different factors from the predefined factors for our own calculation and naming them suitably. Also, we are checking each factor while correlating with the ‘Close’ column while sorting it in descending order.

By, observing the correlating factors, we can choose a few of them. We are excluding High, Low, and Open as they are highly correlated from the beginning.

Introducing the ARIMA model for Time Series Analysis. ARIMA stands for autoregressive integrated moving average model and is specified by three order parameters: (p, d, q) where AR stands for Autoregression i.e. p, I stands for Integration i.e. d, MA stands for Moving Average i.e. q. Whereas, SARIMAX is Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables.

Let’s implement the SARIMAX model and see the results.
Now, observe the prediction in time series.

Importing Libraries and dataset

Generating Word Embeddings
Model Architecture
Model Evaluation and Prediction

Importing Libraries and Dataset
Preprocessing Dataset
As we can see the dataset contains one unnamed column. So we drop that column from the dataset.
Data Encoding
It converts the categorical column (label in out case) into numerical values.
Tokenization 
This process divides a large piece of continuous text into distinct units or tokens basically. Here we use columns separately for a temporal basis as a pipeline just for good accuracy.
Applying Tokenization

Generating Word Embedding
It allows words with similar meanings to have a similar representation. Here each individual word is represented as real-valued vectors in a predefined vector space. For that we will use glove.6B.50d.txt. It has the predefined vector space for words. 
Creating Model Architecture
Now it’s time to introduce TensorFlow to create the model.  Here we use the TensorFlow embedding technique with Keras Embedding Layer where we map original input data into some set of real-valued dimensions.

Model Evaluation and Prediction
Now, the detection model is built using TensorFlow. Now we will try to test the model by using some news text by predicting whether it is true or false.

These codes provide a comprehensive approach to building machine learning models for detecting fake news using TensorFlow and traditional classification algorithms.",36.185988,,eb4b8b40-5a97-4603-a7c2-ea253b7cf1ee,1.0,"ake News means incorporating information that leads people to the wrong paths. It can have real-world adverse effects that aim to intentionally deceive, gain attention, manipulate public opinion, or damage reputation. It is necessary to detect fake news mainly for media outlets to have the ability to attract viewers to their website to generate online advertising revenue.

Fake News Detection Model using TensorFlow in Python
In this article, we are going to develop a Deep learning model using Tensorflow and use this model to detect whether the news is fake or not.

We will be using fake_news_dataset, which contains News text and corresponding label (FAKE or REAL).

Now anayze the data, write Python code to build up machine learning model"
"Importing Dataset
The dataset taken for the task includes the details of customers includes their marital status, their income, number of items purchased, types of items purchased, and so on.
To check the shape of the dataset we can use data.shape method.

Improving the values in the Accepted column.
To check the null values in the dataset.

Here we can observe that there are columns which contain single values in the whole column so, they have no relevance in the model development.

Also dataset has a column Dt_Customer which contains the date column, we can convert into 3 columns i.e. day, month, year. 
Now we have all the important features, we can now drop features like Z_CostContact, Z_Revenue, Dt_Customer.

Data Visualization and Analysis
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data in a pictorial or graphical format. Here we will be using bar plot and count plot for better visualization.

To get the count plot for the columns of the datatype – object, refer the code below.

Let’s check the value_counts of the Marital_Status of the data.

Now lets see the comparison of the features with respect to the values of the responses.

Label Encoding  
Label Encoding is used to convert the categorical values into the numerical values so that model can understand it.

Heatmap is the best way to visualize the correlation among the different features of dataset. Let’s give it the value of 0.8

 

Standardization
Standardization is the method of feature scaling which is an integral part of feature engineering. It scales down the data and making it easier for the machine learning model to learn from it. It reduces the mean to ‘0’ and the standard deviation to ‘1’.

Segmentation
We will be using T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. It helps in visualizing high-dimensional data. It converts similarities between data points to joint probabilities and tries to minimize the values to low-dimensional embedding.

There are certainly some clusters which are clearly visual from the 2-D representation of the given data. Let’s use the KMeans algorithm to find those clusters in the high dimensional plane itself

KMeans Clustering can also be used to cluster the different points in a plane.

Here by using the elbow method we can say that k = 6 is the optimal number of clusters that should be made as after k = 6 the value of the inertia is not decreasing drastically.

Scatterplot will be used to see all the 6 clusters formed by KMeans Clustering.

This methodology will help enhance the company's ability to tailor products and marketing strategies according to customer segments, improving overall customer satisfaction and market value.",29.951632,,d4e85ee7-3a33-40bb-b04c-4f3b7b5c9fc0,1.0,"n today’s era, companies work hard to make their customers happy. They launch new technologies and services so that customers can use their products more. They try to be in touch with each of their customers so that they can provide goods accordingly. But practically, it’s very difficult and non-realistic to keep in touch with everyone. So, here comes the usage of Customer Segmentation.

Customer Segmentation means the segmentation of customers on the basis of their similar characteristics, behavior, and needs. This will eventually help the company in many ways. Like, they can launch the product or enhance the features accordingly. They can also target a particular sector as per their behaviors. All of these lead to an enhancement in the overall market value of the company.

For protecting the privacy of the user the dimensionality of the data can be reduced.
A more trustworthy source must be taken which double-check the data, at least for training the model.
We can make the model simple and interpretable so that when the scammer adapts to it with just some tweaks we can have a new model up and running to deploy.

Imbalanced Data i.e most of the transactions (99.8%) are not fraudulent which makes it really hard for detecting the fraudulent ones
Data availability as the data is mostly private.

Importing Libraries and Datasets
Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing and analysis of News column
Converting text into Vectors
Model training, Evaluation, and Prediction

Let’s import the downloaded dataset. 

Data preprocessing
As the title, subject and date column will not going to be helpful in identification of the news. So, we can drop these column.
Now, we have to check if there is any null value (we will drop those rows)

Now we have to shuffle the dataset to prevent the model to get bias. After that we will reset the index and then drop it. Because index column is not useful to us.

Now Let’s explore the unique values in the each category using below code.

Preprocessing and analysis of News column
Firstly we will remove all the stopwords, punctuations and any irrelevant spaces from the text. For that NLTK Library is required and some of it’s module need to be downloaded. So, for that run the below code.

Once we have all the required modules, we can create a function name preprocess text. This function will preprocess all the data given as input.

To implement the function in all the news in the text column, run the below command.

Let’s visualize the WordCloud for fake and real news separately.

Now, Let’s plot the bargraph of the top 20 most frequent words.

Converting text into Vectors
Before converting the data into vectors, split it into train and test.
Now we can convert the training data into vectors using TfidfVectorizer.

Model training, Evaluation, and Prediction
Now, the dataset is ready to train the model.

For training we will use Logistic Regression and evaluate the prediction accuracy using accuracy_score.

Let’s train with Decision Tree Classifier. 

The confusion matrix for Decision Tree Classifier can be implemented with the code below.

Now anayze the data, write Python code to build up machine learning model"
"Reading the dataset
Firstly we will be loading the dataset from the folders using the pandas library. While reading the dataset we will be dropping the null column. This dataset is a clean dataset with no null values and all the features consist of 0’s and 1s. Whenever we are solving a classification task it is necessary to check whether our target column is balanced or not. We will be using a bar plot, to check whether the dataset is balanced or not.  

From the above plot, we can observe that the dataset is a balanced dataset i.e. there are exactly 120 samples for each disease, and no further balancing is required. We can notice that our target column i.e. prognosis column is of object datatype, this format is not suitable to train a machine learning model. So, we will be using a label encoder to convert the prognosis column to the numerical datatype. Label Encoder converts the labels into numerical form by assigning a unique index to the labels. If the total number of labels is n, then the numbers assigned to each label will be between 0 to n-1.

Splitting the data for training and testing the model
Now that we have cleaned our data by removing the Null values and converting the labels to numerical format, It’s time to split the data to train and test the model. We will be splitting the data into 80:20 format i.e. 80% of the dataset will be used for training the model and 20% of the data will be used to evaluate the performance of the models

Model Building
After splitting the data, we will be now working on the modeling part. We will be using K-Fold cross-validation to evaluate the machine-learning models. We will be using Support Vector Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier for cross-validation. Before moving into the implementation part let us get familiar with k-fold cross-validation and the machine learning models. 

K-Fold Cross-Validation: K-Fold cross-validation is one of the cross-validation techniques in which the whole dataset is split into k number of subsets, also known as folds, then training of the model is performed on the k-1 subsets and the remaining one subset is used to evaluate the model performance.
Support Vector Classifier: Support Vector Classifier is a discriminative classifier i.e. when given a labeled training data, the algorithm tries to find an optimal hyperplane that accurately separates the samples into different categories in hyperspace.
Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier: It is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm that internally uses Bayes Theorem to classify the data points.
Random Forest Classifier: Random Forest is an ensemble learning-based supervised machine learning classification algorithm that internally uses multiple decision trees to make the classification. In a random forest classifier, all the internal decision trees are weak learners, and the outputs of these weak decision trees are combined i.e. mode of all the predictions is as the final prediction.

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Data Loading:** The training and testing datasets are loaded from CSV files.
- **Data Visualization:** The distribution of diseases is visualized to check if the dataset is balanced.
- **Data Encoding:** The target variable `prognosis` is converted from string to numerical format using `LabelEncoder`.
- **Train-Test Split:** The dataset is divided into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%).
- **Model Building:** Three classifiers (SVC, GaussianNB, RandomForest) are initialized and trained using K-Fold Cross-Validation.
- **Model Evaluation:** Each model's accuracy is evaluated and confusion matrices are plotted for visual assessment of prediction performance.
- **Ensemble Learning:** Predictions from all three models are combined using a majority vote to improve the overall prediction accuracy.

This structured approach ensures a robust machine learning model for disease prediction based on symptoms.",38.917219,,44eee945-f9cc-45b0-97f5-ab9ff49d2c0e,1.0,"Approach:

Gathering the Data: Data preparation is the primary step for any machine learning problem. We will be using a dataset from Kaggle for this problem. This dataset consists of two CSV files one for training and one for testing. There is a total of 133 columns in the dataset out of which 132 columns represent the symptoms and the last column is the prognosis.
Cleaning the Data: Cleaning is the most important step in a machine learning project. The quality of our data determines the quality of our machine-learning model. So it is always necessary to clean the data before feeding it to the model for training. In our dataset all the columns are numerical, the target column i.e. prognosis is a string type and is encoded to numerical form using a label encoder.
Model Building: After gathering and cleaning the data, the data is ready and can be used to train a machine learning model. We will be using this cleaned data to train the Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. We will be using a confusion matrix to determine the quality of the models.
Inference: After training the three models we will be predicting the disease for the input symptoms by combining the predictions of all three models. This makes our overall prediction more robust and accurate.
Detail:
1. Data Gathering and Preparation:
Data Loading:

The dataset consists of two CSV files: one for training (dataset/Training.csv) and one for testing (dataset/Testing.csv).
The dataset is clean with no null values, and all features are binary (0’s and 1’s).
The target column (prognosis) is initially a string and is converted to numerical values using LabelEncoder.
Data Visualization:

A bar plot is used to visualize the distribution of diseases in the dataset to ensure it is balanced (each disease has 120 samples).
2. Data Cleaning:
The dataset does not have null values, so no extensive cleaning is required.
The prognosis column is encoded into numerical format using LabelEncoder.
3. Data Splitting:
The data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split.
4. Model Building:
K-Fold Cross-Validation:

K-Fold Cross-Validation is used to evaluate the models, splitting the dataset into k subsets for training and validation.
Model Selection:

Three models are chosen:
Support Vector Classifier (SVC): Separates classes by finding an optimal hyperplane.
Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier: A probabilistic model using Bayes’ Theorem.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees.
5. Model Training and Evaluation:
Each model is trained and evaluated using accuracy on both the training and testing datasets.
Confusion matrices are plotted to visualize the performance of each model on the test data.
6. Ensemble Learning:
The final predictions are made by combining the predictions of all three models using the mode (majority vote) to improve robustness and accuracy.
The combined model is then evaluated on the test data, and the confusion matrix is plotted.

"Let’s classify cancer cells based on their features, and identifying them if they are ‘malignant’ or ‘benign’. We will be using scikit-learn for a machine learning problem. Scikit-learn is an open-source machine learning, data mining and data analysis library for Python programming language.
The dataset: 
Scikit-learn comes with a few small standard datasets that do not require downloading any file from any external website. The dataset that we will be using for our machine learning problem is the Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset. The dataset includes several data about the breast cancer tumors along with the classifications labels, viz., malignant or benign. It can be loaded using the following function: 

Step by step implementation of classification using Scikit-learn:
Step #1: Importing the necessary module and dataset.
We will be needing the ‘Scikit-learn’ module and the Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset. 

Step #2: Loading the dataset to a variable. 

The important attributes that we must consider from that dataset are ‘target-names'(the meaning of the labels), ‘target'(the classification labels), ‘feature_names'(the meaning of the features) and ‘data'(the data to learn).
Step #3: Organizing the data and looking at it. 
To get a better understanding of what the dataset contains and how we can use the data to train our model, let us first organize the data and then see what it contains by using the print() function. 

From here, we see that each label is linked to binary values of 0 and 1, where 0 represents malignant tumors and 1 represents benign tumors. 

Here, we see all the 30 features or attributes that each dataset of the tumor has. We will be using the numerical values of these features in training our model and make the correct prediction, whether or not a tumor is malignant or benign, based on these features. 

Step #4: Organizing the data into Sets.
For testing the accuracy of our classifier, we must test the model on unseen data. So, before building the model, we will split our data into two sets, viz., training set and test set. We will be using the training set to train and evaluate the model and then use the trained model to make predictions on the unseen test set. 
The sklearn module has a built-in function called the train_test_split(), which automatically divides the data into these sets. We will be using this function to split the data. 
 
The train_test_split() function randomly splits the data using the parameter test_size. What we have done here is that we have split 33% of the original data into test data (test). The remaining data (train) is the training data. Also, we have respective labels for both the train variables and test variables, i.e. train_labels and test_labels.

Step #5: Building the Model.
There are many machine learning models to choose from. All of them have their own advantages and disadvantages. For this model, we will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm that usually performs well in binary classification tasks. Firstly, import the GaussianNB module and initialize it using the GaussianNB() function. Then train the model by fitting it to the data in the dataset using the fit() method.


After the training is complete, we can use the trained model to make predictions on our test set that we have prepared before. To do that, we will use the built-in predict() function which returns an array of prediction values for data instance in the test set. We will then print our predictions using the print() function. 

Step #6: Evaluating the trained model’s accuracy.
As we have predicted values now, we can evaluate our model’s accuracy by comparing it with the actual labels of the test set, i.e., comparing predictions with test_labels. For this purpose, we will be using the built-in accuracy_score() function in the sklearn module. 

# Step #1: Importing the necessary module and dataset.
import sklearn
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

# Step #2: Loading the dataset to a variable.
data = load_breast_cancer()

# Step #3: Organizing the data and looking at it.
label_names = data['target_names']
labels = data['target']
feature_names = data['feature_names']
features = data['data']

# Looking at the data
print(label_names)
print(labels)
print(feature_names)

# Step #4: Organizing the data into Sets.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Splitting the data
train, test, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)

# Step #5: Building the Model.
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB

# Initializing the classifier
gnb = GaussianNB()

# Training the classifier
model = gnb.fit(train, train_labels)

# Making the predictions
predictions = gnb.predict(test)

# Printing the predictions
print(predictions)

### Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

1. **Problem Formulation:**
   - This is a **supervised learning** problem where we predict a binary target variable (`TenYearCHD`) based on various feature variables (e.g., `age`, `Sex_male`, `cigsPerDay`, `totChol`, `sysBP`, `glucose`).
   - **Features**: `['age', 'Sex_male', 'cigsPerDay', 'totChol', 'sysBP', 'glucose']`
   - **Target**: `'TenYearCHD'`

2. **Data Processing:**
   - The dataset is cleaned by dropping the unnecessary `education` column and handling missing values by removing rows with NaN values.
   - The `male` column is renamed to `Sex_male` for clarity.
   - Standardization of features is applied to ensure they are on the same scale.
   - The data is split into training and testing sets (70% train, 30% test).

3. **Model Selection:**
   - The **Logistic Regression** model is selected as it is suitable for binary classification problems and provides interpretable results.

### Python Code for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Loading the dataset
framingham_data = pd.read_csv('framingham.csv')

# Data Processing
# Dropping the education column
framingham_data.drop(columns=['education'], inplace=True)

# Handling missing values
framingham_data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Renaming the male column to Sex_male
framingham_data.rename(columns={'male': 'Sex_male'}, inplace=True)

# Features and Target
X = framingham_data[['age', 'Sex_male', 'cigsPerDay', 'totChol', 'sysBP', 'glucose']]
Y = framingham_data['TenYearCHD']

# Standardization
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Data Splitting
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, Y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Model Selection and Training

### Summary
- The first model focuses on predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease using logistic regression, while the second model classifies breast cancer tumors using Gaussian Naive Bayes.
- Both implementations include data processing steps, model training, and evaluation metrics to assess performance.",27.01648,,84f7cde5-36bc-42c1-92c0-d58319c83c46,0.0,"Machine Learning is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence that gives systems the ability to learn themselves without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine Learning can be used in solving many real world problems. 
Let’s classify cancer cells based on their features, and identifying them if they are ‘malignant’ or ‘benign’. We will be using scikit-learn for a machine learning problem. Scikit-learn is an open-source machine learning, data mining and data analysis library for Python programming language.

Now anayze the data, write Python code to build up machine learning model"
"Loading Dataset
Now let’s load the dataset into a pandas data frame and look at the first five rows of the dataset. Dataset link

For a better understanding, we’ll plot these counts:

Text Preprocessing
Textual data is highly unstructured and need attention in many aspects:

Stopwords Removal
Punctuations Removal
Stemming or Lemmatization
Although removing data means loss of information we need to do this to make the data perfect to feed into a machine learning model.

Word2Vec Conversion
We cannot feed words to a machine learning model because they work on numbers only. So, first, we will convert our words to vectors with the token IDs to the corresponding words and after padding them our textual data will arrive to a stage where we can feed it to a model.

Model Development and Evaluation
We will implement a Sequential model which will contain the following parts:

Three Embedding Layers to learn featured vector representations of the input vectors.
An LSTM layer to identify useful patterns in the sequence.
Then we will have one fully connected layer.
The final layer is the output layer which outputs probabilities for the two classes. 

While compiling a model we provide these three essential parameters:

optimizer – This is the method that helps to optimize the cost function by using gradient descent.
loss – The loss function by which we monitor whether the model is improving with training or not.
metrics – This helps to evaluate the model by predicting the training and the validation data.

Callback
Callbacks are used to check whether the model is improving with each epoch or not. If not then what are the necessary steps to be taken like ReduceLROnPlateau decreases the learning rate further? Even then if model performance is not improving then training will be stopped by EarlyStopping. We can also define some custom callbacks to stop training in between if the desired results have been obtained early.

Train the model

Now, let’s evaluate the model on the validation data.


Model Evaluation Results
Having trained our model, we can plot a graph depicting the variance of training and validation accuracies with the no. of epochs.

### Explanation of the Code
- **Data Cleaning**: The function `clean_text` is used to preprocess the email content by removing unnecessary information and cleaning the text.
- **Balancing the Dataset**: The `RandomUnderSampler` from the `imblearn` library resamples the dataset to balance the classes.
- **Feature Engineering**: The text data is tokenized and converted into padded sequences to be fed into the LSTM model.
- **Model Construction**: A sequential model is built using Keras with embedding, LSTM, and dropout layers for regularization.
- **Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set, printing accuracy and a classification report.

This structured approach helps in effectively building a spam detection model using machine learning techniques.",24.460495,,7b490afe-70af-4dd5-9bbd-84af7d795896,1.0,"Spam messages refer to unsolicited or unwanted messages/emails that are sent in bulk to users. In most messaging/emailing services, messages are detected as spam automatically so that these messages do not unnecessarily flood the users’ inboxes.

### Summary of the Wine Quality Dataset
The wine quality dataset is a well-known dataset used for various machine learning tasks, particularly in classification and regression problems. It typically consists of several features that describe the characteristics of different wines and a target variable that indicates the quality of the wine.

### Key Features of the Wine Quality Dataset:
1. **Fixed Acidity**: Measure of the amount of acid in the wine.
2. **Volatile Acidity**: Measure of the wine's tendency to turn into vinegar.
3. **Citric Acid**: Measure of the freshness of the wine.
4. **Residual Sugar**: Amount of sugar remaining after fermentation.
5. **Chlorides**: Measure of salt in the wine.
6. **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: Amount of sulfur dioxide available to protect the wine from oxidation.
7. **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: Total amount of sulfur dioxide present.
8. **Density**: Measure of the mass of the wine per unit volume.
9. **pH**: Measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the wine.
10. **Sulphates**: Measure of the presence of sulfates in the wine, which can affect taste.
11. **Alcohol**: Alcohol content of the wine.
12. **Quality**: Target variable, usually a score between 0 and 10, indicating the quality of the wine.

For further details, you can refer to the [Wine Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).",29.541562,,4003940b-9092-42b4-995b-c234312f3529,1.0,"We use deep learning for the large data sets but to understand the concept of deep learning, we use the small data set of wine quality. You can find the wine quality data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which is available for free. The aim of this article is to get started with the libraries of deep learning such as Keras, etc and to be familiar with the basis of neural network. 
About the Data Set : 
Before we start loading in the data, it is really important to know about your data. The data set consist of 12 variables that are included in the data. Few of them are as follows – 
 

Fixed acidity : The total acidity is divided into two groups: the volatile acids and the nonvolatile or fixed acids.The value of this variable is represented by in gm/dm3 in the data sets.
Volatile acidity: The volatile acidity is a process of wine turning into vinegar. In this data sets, the volatile acidity is expressed in gm/dm3.
Citric acid : Citric acid is one of the fixed acids in wines. It’s expressed in g/dm3 in the data sets.
Residual Sugar : Residual Sugar is the sugar remaining after fermentation stops, or is stopped. It’s expressed in g/dm3 in the data set.
Chlorides : It can be a important contributor to saltiness in wine. The value of this variable is represented by in gm/dm3 in the data sets.
Free sulfur dioxide : It is the part of the sulfur dioxide that is added to a wine. The value of this variable is represented by in gm/dm3 in the data sets.
Total Sulfur Dioxide : It is the sum of the bound and the free sulfur dioxide.The value of this variable is represented by in gm/dm3 in the data sets.


Here is the organized project text and code following the outlined format:
