"Find the least positive value of x such that 71 ≡ x  (mod 8)
","71 ≡ x (mod 8)
64 ≡ 0 (mod 8)
64+7 ≡ 0+7 (mod 8)
71 ≡ 7 (mod 8)
So x = 7."
Find the least positive value of x such that 78 + x ≡ 3 (mod 5),"78+x ≡ 3(mod 5)
78+x-3 = 5n for some integer n
75+x = 5n
75+x is a multiple of 5
Hence the least positive value of x must be 5, since so is the nearest value multiple of 5 more than 75."
Find the least positive value of x such that 89 ≡ (x + 3) (mod 4),"89 ≡ (x+3) (mod 4)
89-(x+3) = 4n for some integer n
86-x = 4n
86-x is a multiple of 4
Therefore the least positive value of x must be 2. Since 86-2 = 84 is the nearest multiple of 4 less than 86."
If x is congruent to 13 modulo 17 then 7x - 3 is congruent to which number modulo 17?,"x ≡ 13 (mod 17)
7x-3 ≡ y (mod 17)
So x-13 = 17n for some integer n
x-13 is a multiple of 17
Therefore the least positive value of x must be 30, since 30-13 = 17 which is multiple of 17
So 7*30-3 ≡ y (mod 17)
210-3-y = 17n for some integer n.
207-y = 7n
207-y is a multiple of 17
Hence the least positive value of y must be 3. Since 207-3 = 214 is a multiple of 17."
Solve 5x ≡ 4 (mod 6),"5x-4 = 6n for some integer n
5x-4 is a multiple of 6
x = (6n+4)/5
When we put n = 1,6,11,16… then 6n+4 is divisible by 5
If n = 1, then x = (6*1+4)/5 = 2
If n = 6, then x = (6*6+4)/5 = 8
Therefore the solutions are 2, 18, 14, 20…"
Solve 3x − 2 ≡ 0 (mod 11),"3x - 2 = 11n for some integer n

3x - 2 is a multiple of 11

x = (11n + 2) / 3

When we put n = 2, 5, 8, ... x is divisible by 3

If n = 2, x = (11×2 + 2) / 3 = 8

If n = 5, x = (11×5 + 2) / 3 = 19

Therefore the solutions are 8, 19, 30, …"
Find the remainder when 2^81 is divided by 17.,"We need to find the remainder when 2^81 is divided by 17.

We know that:
2^3 = 8 (mod 17)

Now, let's cube both sides:
(2^3)^3 = 8^3 (mod 17)

This simplifies to:
2^9 = 512 (mod 17)

When we calculate 512 mod 17, we get:
512 = 2 (mod 17)

Therefore, 2^9 is congruent to 2 modulo 17.
Next, raise both sides to the 9th power:
(2^9)^9 = 2^81 (mod 17)

This simplifies further to:
2^81 = 512 (mod 17)

Since 512 = 2 (mod 17), we have:
2^81 = 2 (mod 17)

So, when 2^81 is divided by 17, the remainder is 2."
Suppose Alice and Bob communicate using the Cocks–Ellis cryptosystem. If Bob’s public key is n = 77 find the encryption of the message M = 15. Find Bob’s private key in this case and use his decryption process to recover M,"p = 7, q = 11, r = 3, s = 5, u = 8, v = 2,C = 71 mod 77."
"Given the RSA public key (n, e) = (62821427, 5) find the private key d. (You may suppose that the public key was chosen insecurely.)","p = 7919 and q = 7933. Thus, using Euclid’s algorithm we find d = 12561115."
Bob uses Rabin’s cryptosystem with public key n = 77. If he receives the cryptogram C = 71 find the four possible messages.,"M = ±15, ±29 mod 77"
